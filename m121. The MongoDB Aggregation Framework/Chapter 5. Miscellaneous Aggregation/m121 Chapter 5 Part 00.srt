00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.499


2
00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.430
Let's learn about
one of the stages

3
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.080
in the aggregation
framework that

4
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.970
can help us protect information
from unauthorized access,

5
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.240
the redact stage.

6
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.360
The redact stage has
the following form.

7
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.170
The expression can be any
expression or combination

8
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.240
of expressions,
but must ultimately

9
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.960
resolve to one of three values,
descend, prune, and keep.

10
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.660
OK, at first these
seem pretty cryptic.

11
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.330
So let's examine what
each of them does.

12
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.720
First, let's look
at prune and keep.

13
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.810
Prune and keep are
inverse of each other.

14
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.680
Prune will exclude all fields
at the current document level

15
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.070
without further inspection,
while keep will retain

16
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.170
all fields at the
current document level

17
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.070
without further inspection.

18
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.690
So what do we mean by
further inspection?

19
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.580
Let's look at this
example document

20
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.710
from the employees collection.

21
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.280
Each colored square
represents a document level.

22
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.540
Specifying keep or prune
at any given document level

23
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.770
will perform the
associated action

24
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.710
and automatically
apply this action

25
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.440
to all levels of the document.

26
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.200
Let's look at this
example document

27
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.480
from the employees collection.

28
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.870
Each colored square
represents a document level.

29
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.560
Specifying keep or prune
at any given document level

30
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.780
will perform the
associated action

31
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.380
and automatically apply this
action to all document levels

32
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.290
below the level we specified.

33
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.810
OK, so let's look at descend.

34
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.960
Descend retains the field at
the current document level

35
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.630
being evaluated except
for subdocuments

36
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.220
and arrays of documents.

37
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.350
It will instead traverse
down, evaluating each level.

38
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.080
Let's visualize how
descend would operate over

39
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.680
this document, given this
conditional expression,

40
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.560
determining whether the
value of user access

41
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.590
is in the ACL array.

42
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.480
We start with the
entire document

43
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.750
and compare whether
management is in ACL.

44
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.780
Since it is, it descends
into the sub document

45
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.979
at employee compensation, here.

46
00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.350
We now evaluate
whether management

47
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.870
is in ACL, which it is.

48
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.150
So we descend further.

49
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.390
At this level, upon
evaluation prune

50
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.660
is returned, because
the ACL at this level

51
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.910
does not include management.

52
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.450
This level and any subsequent
levels, if there were any,

53
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.760
would not be returned.

54
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.360
To the user, it's as if this
field doesn't exist at all.

55
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.650
Let's look at this in action.

56
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.380
We set up our user access
variable and then the pipeline,

57
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.880
ensuring we only have access
document levels we should.

58
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.750
Excellent.

59
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.060
We can see that we are
indeed only getting back

60
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.400
document levels where
management was in the ACL array.

61
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.060
The redact stage can be useful
for implementing access control

62
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.190
lists, though it
is not the only way

63
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.440
to limit access to
information, as we'll

64
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.660
learn later in the course.

65
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.670
Any user who has
access to a collection

66
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.710
to perform this
type of aggregation

67
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.170
can also perform
other read operations.

68
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.110
So the redact stage is not
sufficient for collection

69
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.150
and field level restrictions.

70
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.130
Lastly, if comparing to
a field in the document,

71
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.990
the field must be present at
every level of using descend,

72
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.510
or the expression must
account for and decide what

73
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.460
to do if the field is missing.

74
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.620
If we don't take any
of these precautions,

75
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.150
redact is likely to error.

76
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.510
Let's summarize some key points.

77
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.870
Keep and prune automatically
apply to all levels

78
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.240
below the evaluated level.

79
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.880
Descend retains
the current level

80
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.670
and evaluates the
next level down.

81
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.010
And redact is not for
restricting access

82
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.430
to a collection.

83
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.930
Remember, if a user has access
to perform an aggregation

84
00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.020
on a collection, they have
access to read that collection.
