1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.390
In some situations, we might not
be interested on the full list.

3
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.870
Let's say, for
example, that we only

4
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.770
want Dave's direct reports
and their direct reports.

5
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.070
So let's say two levels down.

6
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.710
Now a single lookup
is depth zero,

7
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.270
meaning that if
we match for Dave

8
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.840
and we are only
interested on knowing

9
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.690
the documents of
its direct reports,

10
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.470
we just need to set the
depth of our lookup to zero.

11
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.470
But if we want to
do two levels down,

12
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.950
we would need to
have a depth of one.

13
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.540
And therefore, we'll find
a full data structures

14
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.940
of Andrew, Elyse, and Ron.

15
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.220
Graph lookup allows
us to do that.

16
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.490
Using the previous
dataset, child reference,

17
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.880
where we have a direct
reports reference

18
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.530
inside of each document.

19
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.630
If you want to go
two levels down,

20
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.940
till_2_level down reports, you
just specify a maxDepth field,

21
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.000
value equals 1, on
our graphLookup.

22
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.390
After we run this, we have
our matching documents.

23
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.690
And then the list of
results of direct reports

24
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.930
to Dave up to two levels down.

25
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.540
So we can see here that,
for example, Andrew

26
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.320
will be listed, as
well as Ron and Elyse,

27
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.280
and obviously, all of
Dave's direct reports.

28
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.660
So basically, maxDepth will
restrict how many times

29
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.050
we want to recursively
find documents

30
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.450
that match or they
are connected using

31
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.330
the FromField and
the connecToField.

32
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.130
But let's say that, apart from
defining a maxDepth field of I

33
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.190
only want to go two
levels down, I also

34
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.670
want to know how far
away are those elements

35
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.900
to the first element
that I find in my lookup.

36
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.610
Basically, I want to know how
many recursive lookups did

37
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.420
I need to do to find the
particular documents.

38
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.890
For that, I have
depthField, which

39
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.610
I can specify a field name
which will tell me exactly that,

40
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.100
how many recursive
lookups were needed

41
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.410
to get this particular point.

42
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.370
When I run this I can see
that Eliot is on number zero,

43
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.150
meaning that I only needed
one single lookup to find it.

44
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.340
Then again, it's the
first base lookup.

45
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.060
Same thing for Meagan,
same thing for Richard,

46
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.500
same thing for Carlos.

47
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.150
But for Andrew, I need to go
one recursive or, in this case,

48
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.410
two recursive lookups down.

49
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.500
Same thing for Ron and
same thing for Elyse.

50
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.810
By specifying
depth field level I

51
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.320
can get the information of how
many recursive lookups were

52
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.230
needed to find that
particular element

53
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.950
on the descendants field here.
