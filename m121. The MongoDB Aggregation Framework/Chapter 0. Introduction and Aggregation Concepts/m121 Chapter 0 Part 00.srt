Hi, I'm Nathan.

3
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.190
Welcome to M121, the MongoDB
Aggregation Framework.

4
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.412
I'll be one of your
instructors for this course.

5
00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:09.870
Throughout this
course, we're going

6
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.840
to discuss the
aggregation framework,

7
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.120
a key feature of MongoDB.

8
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.620
You'll learn about expressive
filtering, powerful data

9
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.310
transformation, statistical
utilities and data analysis,

10
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.090
and how to do much more work
with a single operation.

11
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.160
This course is
seven chapters long.

12
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.640
With each chapter, there will
be a new set of lesson videos.

13
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.320
After most of these
lessons, there

14
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.110
will be a quiz to assess your
learning of the material.

15
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.660
At the end of each
chapter, there

16
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.530
will be a set of
related lab exercises.

17
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.160
Let's go over a few of
the course logistics.

18
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.950
The target audience-- this
is a beginner's course

19
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.110
focused on developer practices.

20
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.580
If you're coming
from an operations

21
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.070
background, fear not,
young grasshopper,

22
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.110
we have something for you too.

23
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.110
It is expected that you are
familiar with the MongoDB query

24
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.160
language.

25
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.490
If you aren't, we recommend you
taking our definitive beginner

26
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.379
course, M001, before
attempting M121.

27
00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.790
How does grading work?

28
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.540
There are quizzes,
labs, and a final exam.

29
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.150
Quizzes are ungraded and
exist to make sure that you're

30
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.890
understanding the content.

31
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.760
Your grade in the
class, however,

32
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.260
will be based on how well you do
on the labs and the final exam,

33
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.830
each of these being worth
50% of your total grade.

34
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.500
Students with a grade
of 65% or greater

35
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.300
will receive a passing
grade and will get

36
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.340
a certificate of completion.

37
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.340
Finally, I'd highly
encourage you to participate

38
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.810
in the discussion forum.

39
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.300
We have knowledgeable teaching
assistants who are there

40
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.500
to answer your questions.

41
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.830
We also have your
classmates who can also

42
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.510
contribute to answering
your questions

43
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.870
and are often beneficial
and knowledgeable resources.

44
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.810
The labs in this course
can be challenging.

45
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.790
Based on our
experience, we've seen

46
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.100
that students who perform
best in the course

47
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.310
are those who are most active
in the discussion forum.

48
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.990
By the end of this
course, you should

49
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.960
be familiar with how to
transform data, perform data

50
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.590
analysis, and reallocate work
to the server from your client

51
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.850
application.

52
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.070
With all of that said,
we're excited to have you

53
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.750
as a student in this course.

54
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.630
Best of luck.
