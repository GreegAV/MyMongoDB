1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.190
Before we dive into
the course, let's

3
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.065
discuss some
prerequisites and walk

4
00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:05.940
through connecting to
the infrastructure that

5
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.160
is going to support the class.

6
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.320
The course prerequisites
are minimal.

7
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.010
All that is required is a
modern 64-bit operating system

8
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.560
and an internet connection
and your participation.

9
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.400
One note-- you'll also need
to be able to make a TCP

10
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.580
connection on port 27017.

11
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.330
This is easy to test.

12
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.545
Visit portquiz.net:27017.

13
00:00:30.545 --> 00:00:33.300
You should see a page that
looks a lot like this.

14
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.610
And make sure that you see
something like this here

15
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.690
that says you've reached
this page on port 27017.

16
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.730
If you don't see
this page, please

17
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.470
contact your network
administrator

18
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.240
about opening up this port.

19
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.550
Additionally, make sure
you post in the forums

20
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.510
so that we can help you
until this issue is resolved.

21
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.540
As you've seen myself and other
instructors use new aggregation

22
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.160
operators throughout
the course, you

23
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.120
are highly encouraged to pause
the video and follow along.

24
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.460
All collections will
perform operations on

25
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.220
will be available to you
in the Class Atlas cluster.

26
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.620
So what's Atlas?

27
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.740
Atlas is MongoDB's
cloud-hosting service.

28
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.400
We'll let MongoDB worry about
optimizing storage, security,

29
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.620
and backing up our
data for this course.

30
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.980
Signing up for Atlas
is easy and free.

31
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.680
Visit mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
and click the Get Started Free

32
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.490
button.

33
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.080
After clicking the
button, go ahead

34
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.960
and fill out your information
and click Get Started Free

35
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.470
again.

36
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.960
And for now, that's it.

37
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.380
We'll be revisiting Atlas
later on in the course.

38
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.245
Next, let's ensure we
have MongoDB installed.

39
00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:44.290
Visit mongodb.com and
click the Download button.

40
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.980
Navigate over to
Enterprise and select

41
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.400
the download that's appropriate
for your operating system.

42
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.530
Enterprise is free
to test and evaluate,

43
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.710
so we'll be using it
throughout the course.

44
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.020
While that's
downloading, let's click

45
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.480
Resources and Documentation.

46
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.130
Click on Tutorials and
click MongoDB Enterprise.

47
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.860
Scroll down and
find the tutorial

48
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.229
for installing
MongoDB Enterprise

49
00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.820
on your specific
operating system.

50
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.020
Lastly, we need to test our
connection to the class Atlas

51
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.640
cluster.

52
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.610
Open a terminal and
paste the information

53
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.100
you find below this video.

54
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.010
Go ahead and type
show dbs to see

55
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.900
all of the available databases
available on the cluster.

56
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.490
Typing show collections
will show collections

57
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.020
within the
aggregations database.

58
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.930
And that's it for the
course prerequisites

59
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.410
in connecting to Atlas.
