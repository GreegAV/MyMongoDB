00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.070


2
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.090
Pipelines.

3
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.680
You'll hear us mention
pipelines quite

4
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.080
a bit throughout the course,
so let's take a few minutes

5
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.970
to discuss what they are.

6
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.540
Pipelines can be thought of as
a conveyor belt in a factory.

7
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.760
Along the line, there are
different assembly stations.

8
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.240
These assembly
stations are stages.

9
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.350
Depending on what we
want to accomplish,

10
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.000
we may have only one stage,
or we may have many stages.

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.680
Pipelines work like this.

12
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.250
Documents, represented by these
squares, enter our pipeline

13
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.532
and begin to flow
into our first stage.

14
00:00:30.532 --> 00:00:32.240
This stage is called
$match, which you'll

15
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.160
be introduced to very soon.

16
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.890
We set this stage up so that
only red and blue squares

17
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.150
make it through.

18
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.160
Next, they flow
through our pipeline

19
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.900
and enter the second stage.

20
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.050
In this example, we'll
call this stage $project.

21
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.410
We set this stage up to
transform our squares

22
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.800
into circles.

23
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.860
This is a small representation
of the power the aggregation

24
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.090
framework offers.

25
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.690
We can transform our data
in almost any way we desire.

26
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.180
We'll be covering the
$project stage in great detail

27
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.950
in later lessons.

28
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.340
This stage represents one of the
many powerful analysis stages

29
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.770
available, and it
is called $group.

30
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.630
Here, we have
configured the stage

31
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.945
to gather all of the documents
that are flowing into it

32
00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:12.440
and produce a
single document that

33
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.570
gives us the ratio of
red to blue circles.

34
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.110
We'll cover $group, and
many other powerful data

35
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.350
analysis stages,
later in the course.

36
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.310
There you have it.

37
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.030
A high-level overview
of what pipelines are.

38
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.010
At the most basic level, they
are a composition of stages,

39
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.620
from one to many, that we
can arrange and configure

40
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.630
in almost any way we like.

41
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.100
The aggregation
framework provides

42
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.610
many stages to allow us to
filter and transform our data.

43
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.790
All we have to do is
compose the pipeline.

44
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.190
Some key takeaways to remember.

45
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.890
Pipelines are a
composition of stages.

46
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.810
Stages are
configurable to produce

47
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.270
desired transformations.

48
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.010
Documents flow
through the stages

49
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.430
like parts in an assembly
line or water through a pipe.

50
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.690
Finally, with only
a few exceptions,

51
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.780
which we'll cover
later, stages can

52
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.910
be arranged in any way we like
and as many as we require.

53
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:04.690
