00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.420
In previous lessons, we used the
word zillions, and introduced

3
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.220
a graphical notation
for representing

4
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.800
the one-to-zillions
relationships.

5
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.780
We extended the
crow's foot notation

6
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.360
by adding fingers the foot
in order to easily see

7
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.430
those zillions sides.

8
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.020
We should also use
the notation used

9
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.840
in this course
for cardinalities.

10
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.260
One thing is to identify
a relationship as one

11
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.210
to zillions, but better
still if you can quantify

12
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.470
that same relationship.

13
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.220
What is the minimum number
of associated document?

14
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.250
The most likely number
and the maximum number.

15
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.230
The maximum number is
what we care the most

16
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.940
about this relationship.

17
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.190
Zillions means something is
humongous, out of proportion,

18
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.230
so watch out for it.

19
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.110
The one-to-zillions
relationship is not

20
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.150
that different
relationship, per se.

21
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.390
It is a subcase of the
one-to-many relationship.

22
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.280
If we have a one to
many relationship

23
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.310
and the many's identified
as 10,000 or more,

24
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.190
we call that relationship
one to zillion.

25
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.620
This means we need to be
mindful of this relationship

26
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.940
every place we use
it in the code.

27
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.950
The last thing you want
the application to do

28
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.800
is to retrieve a document
and its zillions associated

29
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.830
documents, then process
the complete results set,

30
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.560
unless this you like
long coffee breaks.

31
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.170
So comment those sections
of the code with directives

32
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.880
on how to handle or reduce the
result set that comes back.

33
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.830
Given the cardinality
of these relationships

34
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.200
and the pressure on
computational resources

35
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.020
to process them, you
need to be on the lookout

36
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.390
for very large arrays
of subdocuments

37
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.060
or unbound arrays of references.

38
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.650
Looking back at
the representation

39
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.990
for the one-to-many
relationships,

40
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.700
we have a single one left--

41
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.220


42
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.740
the representation where
we referenced the document

43
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.450
on the one side of
the relationship

44
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.450
from the many or zillion side.

45
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.595
As you model this relationship,
make an effort to quantify it.

46
00:01:50.595 --> 00:01:52.220
This will become
important, so that you

47
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.590
can understand the impact
of the maximum value

48
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.870
on your resources.

49
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.550
To recap the one-to-zillions
relationship,

50
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.545
it is a particular case of
the one-to-many relationship.

51
00:02:03.545 --> 00:02:04.920
The only available
representation

52
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.570
is to reference a
document on the one

53
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.020
side of the relationship
from the zillion side.

54
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.200
And finally, pay extra
attention to queries and code

55
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.430
that handles zillions
of documents.
