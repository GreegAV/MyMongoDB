00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.258


2
00:00:00.258 --> 00:00:02.550
In this lesson, we're going
to cover the list of things

3
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.080
that you'll need to know
prior to taking this course.

4
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.950
If any of the items in this
lesson are unfamiliar to you,

5
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.720
feel free to pause
this video and fill

6
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.750
in those gaps in knowledge
before proceeding.

7
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.370
First and foremost,
we're looking

8
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.230
for database fundamentals.

9
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.090
Terms like table, collection,
database, relationship, schema,

10
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.780
entity, and database
transaction should already

11
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.880
be part of your vocabulary.

12
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.010
If you're comfortable
in using and explaining

13
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.680
these and other related terms,
then you're in good shape.

14
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.560
You can refresh your
memory on most of these

15
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.740
by following the reference
links in the lecture notes.

16
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.650
Another good thing to know
about is the entity relationship

17
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.100
diagram and the appropriate
notation that comes with that.

18
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.110
Does the image in
the right make sense?

19
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.350
What is the relationship between
the student and course tables?

20
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.270
If you can answer these
questions comfortably,

21
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.480
then you're prepared
to take this course.

22
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.320
Otherwise, check
out the references

23
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.150
in the lecture notes.

24
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.880
There is, of course, a softer
requirement for this course,

25
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.810
as well.

26
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.570
Using Compass, you'll need to
be able to connect to the M320

27
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.850
MongoDB Atlas cluster
that was created

28
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.638
for the purposes of this course.

29
00:01:07.638 --> 00:01:09.180
We will walk you
through this process

30
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.610
in one of the following
lectures in the meantime, if you

31
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.860
want to read up on Atlas,
feel free to check out

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.850
