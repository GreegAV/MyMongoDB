00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.140
Hi.

3
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.190
I'm Daniel, one of your
instructors for this course.

4
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.010
Did you ever wonder what is the
single most important aspect

5
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.520
of using MongoDB to
ensure good performance,

6
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.680
maximize the productivity
of your developers,

7
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.530
and minimize the overall
cost of your solution?

8
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.630
Yes-- a good data model.

9
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.430
Welcome to M320, the data
modeling course for MongoDB.

10
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.540
In this course, we're going
to discuss all aspects of data

11
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.800
modeling for MongoDB.

12
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.990
You'll learn how to gather the
requirements to create the data

13
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.240
model, learn those requirements
into a basic model,

14
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.630
apply powerful transformation
patterns to optimize your data

15
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.140
model, and finally, understand
how to evolve your data

16
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.900
model over time.

17
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.520
Armed with that
knowledge, you'll

18
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.660
be able to design schema to
make the best use of MongoDB.

19
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.947


20
00:00:52.947 --> 00:00:55.760
This course is
five chapters long.

21
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.390
With each chapter, there
is a set of lesson videos.

22
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.060
After most of these
lessons, there

23
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.060
is a quiz and labs to assess
your learning of the material.

24
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.270
Let's go over a few
logistics for the course.

25
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.590
What's the target audience?

26
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.050
It's an advanced course.

27
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.170
It is geared more toward
architects and developers, then

28
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.350
DevOp people.

29
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.710
However, everyone
can benefit from it.

30
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.770
If you're used to tabular
or relational databases,

31
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.340
we try to make the
parallel between MongoDB

32
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.040
and these databases.

33
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.850
This course has another
course as a prerequisite,

34
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.740
M001, Introduction to MongoDB.

35
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.280
If you have not
done this course,

36
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.340
you should be familiar
with the following--

37
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.100
using a cluster
deploy in Atlas, using

38
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.460
Compass to access the cluster,
and you should also be familiar

39
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.670
with database concepts
and vocabulary,

40
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.780
reading an entity relationship
diagram using the Crow's Foot

41
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.670
notation.

42
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.360
If you're not, we recommend
you take our beginners course,

43
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.440
M001, and go through the
additional external resources

44
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.750
we reference in the first
lesson of this course.

45
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.600


46
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.520
How does grading work?

47
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.910
There are quizzes,
labs, and a final exam.

48
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.760
Quizzes are ungraded and
exist to make sure that you

49
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.350
understand the content.

50
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.940
Your grade in the
class will be based

51
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.150
on how well you do on the
labs and the final exam,

52
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.940
each of these being
worth 50% of your grade.

53
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.480
To receive a certificate
of course completion,

54
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.050
you need a passing
grade of 65% or higher.

55
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.410
Finally, we will highly
encourage you to participate

56
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.120
in the discussion forum.

57
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.810
We have knowledgeable MongoDB
employees who are there

58
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.390
to help answer your questions.

59
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.410
You also have your
classmates, who can also

60
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.820
contribute to
answering your question

61
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.630
and are often beneficial and
very knowledgeable resources.

62
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.140
We've observed that students
who perform best in the courses

63
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.810
are those who are the most
active in the discussion forum.

64
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.570


65
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.370
By the end of this
course, you should

66
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.580
be ready to design schema
for your applications.

67
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.070
With all that said,
we're excited to have you

68
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.580
as a student in this class.
