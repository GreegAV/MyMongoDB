Let's answer some concerns the usage of patterns may arise.

Patterns are a way to get the best out of your data model.

Often, the main goal is to optimize your schema to respond to some performance operation or optimize it for a given use case or access pattern.

Although like many things in life, good things come at a cost.

Many patterns lead to some situations that would require some additional actions.

For example, duplicating data across documents, accepting staleness in some pieces of data, writing extra application side logic to ensure referential integrity.

Choosing a pattern to be applied to your schema requires taking into account these three concerns.

If these concerns are more important than the potential simplicity of performance gains provided by the pattern, you should not use the pattern.
