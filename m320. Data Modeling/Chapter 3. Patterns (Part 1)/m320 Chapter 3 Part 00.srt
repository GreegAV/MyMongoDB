00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.130
In the previous
chapters, we went

3
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.650
over the basis of data
modeling for MongoDB,

4
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.540
from defining a
flexible methodology

5
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.360
to identifying the different
representation for modeling

6
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.780
relationships.

7
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.540
You should now have
all the knowledge

8
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.540
needed to attack this
week's chapter on patterns.

9
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.360
Patterns are very
exciting because they

10
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.910
are the most powerful
tool for designing schemas

11
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.582
for MongoDB and NoSQL.

12
00:00:23.582 --> 00:00:26.040
This chapter is going to help
you produce solution that can

13
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.070
scale and perform under stress.

14
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.500
Before we go any
further, let me tell you

15
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.550
how we define the word
pattern in our course.

16
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.380
Patterns are not full
solution to problems.

17
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.080
Those are called full solutions.

18
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.230
Patterns are a smaller
section of those solutions.

19
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.982
They are reusable
units of knowledge.

20
00:00:45.982 --> 00:00:47.940
For those of you who are
familiar with software

21
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.890
architecture
design, you probably

22
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.100
know the Design Patterns
book from the Gang of Four.

23
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.190
This book is doing for software
design what our patterns will

24
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.410
do for data modeling and schema
design for document databases.

25
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.540
The patterns we'll go
over in this chapter

26
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.180
will become a cookbook of
powerful transformation

27
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.540
to unleash the power
of MongoDB schemas.

28
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.540
We will see how to optimize
when faced with large documents

29
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.990
with a subset pattern, use
the computed pattern to avoid

30
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.540
repeated computations,
structure similar fields

31
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.760
with the attribute
pattern, handle changes

32
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.010
to your deployment without
downtime with the schema

33
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.930
versioning pattern,
and much more.

34
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.690
Those patterns will also
serve as a common language

35
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.930
for your teams working
on schema designs.

36
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.600
Finally, having
well-defined patterns

37
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.350
and understanding when
and how to use them

38
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.160
will remove a little
bit of the are in data

39
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.450
modeling for MongoDB and make
the process more predictable.

40
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.510
This chapter will have a lesson
to introduce each pattern.

41
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.580
Then we will follow
with a lab to have

42
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.060
you put in practice the
pattern you just learned about.

43
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.650
There is a lot to cover.

44
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.260
However, it will be fun,
and you should profit a lot.

45
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.440
So let's get going.
