2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.270
Let's answer some concerns the
usage of patterns may arise.

3
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.340
Patterns are a way to get the
best out of your data model.

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.500
Often, the main goal is
to optimize your schema

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.020
to respond to some
performance operation

6
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.840
or optimize it for a given
use case or access pattern.

7
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.630
Although like many
things in life,

8
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.970
good things come at a cost.

9
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.220
Many patterns lead
to some situations

10
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.080
that would require some
additional actions.

11
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.360
For example, duplicating data
across documents, accepting

12
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.530
staleness in some
pieces of data,

13
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.660
writing extra
application side logic

14
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.360
to ensure referential integrity.

15
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.460
Choosing a pattern to be
applied to your schema

16
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.670
requires taking into account
these three concerns.

17
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.320
If these concerns
are more important

18
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.500
than the potential simplicity
of performance gains provided

19
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.579
by the pattern, you should
not use the pattern.

20
00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:53.079
