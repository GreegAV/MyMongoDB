00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.540
What a week.

3
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.670
Don't worry if it looks
like a lot of information.

4
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.580
You can always go back
to a specific pattern

5
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.600
later, if you forgot
about it and suspect

6
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.928
it may be a good match for
the schema you're working on.

7
00:00:10.928 --> 00:00:12.720
Let's have a quick
overview of the affinity

8
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.630
[? for ?] patterns with
the common use cases.

9
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.210
I want to stress the point
that the patterns we identified

10
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.160
under a given use case
are not necessarily

11
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.170
all applicable to your problem.

12
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.290
Neither the ones not
selected should be discarded.

13
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.350
The tables simply highlights the
most likely and most important

14
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.830
ones that may appear
for a given use case.

15
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.960
For example, while
working on the Internet

16
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.360
of Things projects,
the project often

17
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.420
uses the bucket patterning.

18
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.190
However, even if
not highlighted,

19
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.040
it may benefit from
the tree pattern,

20
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.690
If the devices organize in
a hierarchy of some sort.

21
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.790
This matrix is
there to guide you

22
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.220
toward the most
likely patterns first.

23
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.490
A special note
about the computed

24
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.580
and the schema versioning
patterns-- the computed pattern

25
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.850
is generic and applicable
to most use cases.

26
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.010
As for the schema
versioning one,

27
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.200
it is applicable
to all use cases.

28
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.980
So ensure you get
a good grasp of it.

29
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.210
Then you'll be ready
to use it, when needed.

30
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.850
In summary, in this chapter,
we learned a few schema design

31
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.930
patterns.

32
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.880
Those act as powerful
transformation,

33
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.770
when designing schema.

34
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.290
If you most likely care
about ease of development

35
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.810
and there's not any difficult
performance requirements

36
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.560
to meet, you may not need
many of those patterns.

37
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.640
The pattern and also provide a
common language for the team.

38
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.500
And finally, using
the patterns lets

39
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.060
you have a more
predictable methodology.
