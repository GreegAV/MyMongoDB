00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.180
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.388
In this lesson, we're going
to talk about the MongoDB

4
00:00:03.388 --> 00:00:07.080
Agent, which is a new agent
coming to office manager 402

5
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.580
and clear manager.

6
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.800
We currently have
three separate agents

7
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.900
to monitor, manage and
backup your deployment

8
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.322
in cloud and Ops Manager.

9
00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:15.780
We have the monitoring
agent, which

10
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.400
is responsible for
gathering metrics

11
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.912
from your MongoDB deployment.

12
00:00:18.912 --> 00:00:20.370
We have the automation
agent, which

13
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.100
is responsible for deploying,
administering and managing

14
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.172
your MongoDB processes.

15
00:00:24.172 --> 00:00:26.505
And the backup agent, which
is responsible for streaming

16
00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:28.350
oplog from your
MongoDB replica set

17
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.590
and keeping your
backups in sync.

18
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.710
Up until now, to use each
individual functionality,

19
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.070
you needed to install and
manage each of these agents.

20
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.070
Each agent was a
separate binary.

21
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.870
We've now combined
the functionality

22
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.110
into a brand new agent
called the MongoDB Agent.

23
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.820
This separate agent
will handle all

24
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.800
of the functionality
of the three agents,

25
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.680
without the need to install
three separate packages.

26
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.570
You simply install
among the MongoDB Agents

27
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.150
and activate which
function you wish to use.

28
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.350
It's important to
note that as before,

29
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.130
if you do not have any process
imported for automation,

30
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.010
the MongoDB Agent will not
automate the processes.

31
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.430
Automation is not mandatory,
but definitely recommended.

32
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.500
Let's install the new agent
and deploy a replica set.

33
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.190
OK, so up to this point, the
entire installation process

34
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.070
has been exactly the same as
it was with previous agents.

35
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.440
Let's start the agent
process and jump into the UI

36
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.110
to see if our agent is pinging
back the Cloud Manager.

37
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.710
OK, great.

38
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.680
We can see that our agent is
pinging by the Cloud Manager.

39
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.190
Now we need to activate which
functions we're going to use.

40
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.240
As we're using a
single server here,

41
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.210
we're going to activate all
functions on this server.

42
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.140
As you can see, moderating and
backup are displayed in the UI.

43
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.000
And that's because
automation will not

44
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.510
be used unless you explicitly
manage your deployment.

45
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.990
If we were using
multiple servers,

46
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.780
we could activate
one or more functions

47
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.520
on each agent
based on the needs,

48
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.348
and how we have our
deployment configured.

49
00:01:49.348 --> 00:01:51.390
Let's activate backup a
monitoring on this agent.

50
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.160


51
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.410
OK, so our changes are deployed
and our agent is ready to go.

52
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.683
OK, so let's add a new replica
set from the Deployment page.

53
00:02:06.683 --> 00:02:08.850
When you come to the replica
set configuration page,

54
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.037
you can either manually
enter all the values,

55
00:02:11.037 --> 00:02:12.870
or you can use the
autofill option, which is

56
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.078
what we're going to use here.

57
00:02:14.078 --> 00:02:16.450


58
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.600
And then we just click
Create Replica Set.

59
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.700
Review and Deploy
and Confirm Deploy.

60
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.850
OK, we can see now that
our change is successfully

61
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.730
deployed.

62
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.937
We have a replica set.

63
00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:26.520
And that's it.

64
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.990
You can now manage,
monitor and backup MongoDB

65
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.700
with a single agent.

66
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.750
So what happens if you already
have the standard agents

67
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.980
installed and running?

68
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.030
No problem.

69
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.720
If you're using managed agents,
i.e., your agents are currently

70
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.140
managed by the automation
agent, when the MongoDB Agent is

71
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.750
available, you will see the
usual banner notification

72
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.400
that your agents
are out of date.

73
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.890
You'll then be guided
through a process in the UI,

74
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.120
and the agents will be
updated to the MongoDB Agent

75
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.120
and assigned the
correct functions.

76
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.430
So at a high level, the
steps are as follows.

77
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.010
The automation agent stops any
monitoring of backup agents.

78
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.270
Then enables
monitoring and backup

79
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.610
on the servers where
monitoring or backup were

80
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.170
running as an agent.

81
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.450
It removes the stopped
monitoring and backup agent

82
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.320
binaries.

83
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.340
And unlocks the MMS monitoring
agent or MMS backup agent users

84
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.090
in the MongoDB instance, so that
you can delete them if desired.

85
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.360
The MongoDB Agent uses the
MMS automation agent user

86
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.420
to connect to your instances.

87
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.460
OK, so if you're using
self managed agents

88
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.500
and manage your agents
yourself, the process

89
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.060
is slightly more involved.

90
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.565
The steps are as follows.

91
00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:33.190
When the automation
agent is available,

92
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.740
you'll see the
banner notification

93
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.350
that your monitoring and
backup agent are out of date.

94
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.050
When you're ready to update,
click Update in the banner.

95
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.450
A workflow that guides you
through the update process

96
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.440
starts.

97
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.440
Once the MongoDB Agent is
installed on the server,

98
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.060
it enables the
monitoring and backup

99
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.700
where they existed as a
standalone agent before.

100
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.910
The MongoDB Agent puts the old
monitoring and backup agents

101
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.150
into standby mode, and no
longer shows them in the UI.

102
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.210
We've created a detailed FAQ
in our docs, which we've linked

103
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.890
in the notes for this lesson.

104
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.260
Rest assured, you will be
supported with the new agent

105
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.130
and the upgrade process.

106
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.210
So let's recap.

107
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.690
We now have one agent which
is responsible for monitoring,

108
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.130
backup and automation.

109
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.920
You no longer need to install
three separate agents to manage

110
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.640
your MongoDB deployment.
