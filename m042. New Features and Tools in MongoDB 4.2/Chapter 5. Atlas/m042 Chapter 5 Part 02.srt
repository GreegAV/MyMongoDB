00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.200
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.575
We've made some improvements
to cloud providers snapshots

4
00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:04.490
in Atlas.

5
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.800
Atlas now supports
Cloud Provider Snapshots

6
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.610
from Microsoft Azure, Amazon
Web Services, and Google Cloud

7
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.693
Platform-backed clusters.

8
00:00:12.693 --> 00:00:14.360
Previously, there
were some restrictions

9
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.610
in the functionality we had
available for Google Cloud

10
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.990
Platform.

11
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.660
We've added incremental backup
functionality using snapshots

12
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.890
in GCP--

13
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.080
that is to say that we
only store a copy which

14
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.450
contains the documents
which have been altered

15
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.460
since the last full backup.

16
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.960
It's important to
note that we're

17
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.780
utilizing the cloud provider's
native capabilities of taking

18
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.950
a snapshot.

19
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.190
These snapshots are
effectively a disk image,

20
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.590
and taking these snapshots is
handled by the cloud provider.

21
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.510
The incremental
approach means that you

22
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.280
incur less cost
due to there being

23
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.890
less data stored per snapshot.

24
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.630
As the incremental
approach only requires

25
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.210
us to store the delta between
these snapshots as opposed

26
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.190
to storing a full
copy of the snapshot,

27
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.130
incremental backups allow you
to store multiple snapshots

28
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.600
without the disk
space requirements

29
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.280
of a non-incremental approach.

30
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.710
This means Atlas now
supports incremental backups

31
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.190
on GCP and AWS using
Cloud Provider Snapshots.

32
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.710
At present, Azure doesn't
offer this incremental backup

33
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.030
capability.

34
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.510
You can now also use GCP
for multi-region backups.

35
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.540
So how does this work?

36
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.498
Atlas selects the primary
member of the cluster

37
00:01:14.498 --> 00:01:17.360
at the time you enable
snapshots for said cluster.

38
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.400
Atlas stores the snapshot
in the same region

39
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.160
as the primary member, and
Atlas retains the snapshots

40
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.248
based on your retention policy.

41
00:01:24.248 --> 00:01:25.790
So Atlas continues
to use that member

42
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.030
and its corresponding region for
snapshots and snapshot storage,

43
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.550
even if that member
is no longer primary.

44
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.140
We automatically create a
new snapshot storage volume

45
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.610
if the existing snapshot storage
volume runs out of disk space.

46
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.980
We then create a new
volume in the same region

47
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.890
as the cluster's
current primary.

48
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.120
Atlas then takes a
full-copy snapshot

49
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.640
to maintain backup
availability and continues

50
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.950
using that member and
its corresponding region

51
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.390
for further
incremental snapshots.

52
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.300
Let's jump into the UI
and configure snapshot

53
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.970
storage for a Google
Cloud-hosted cluster.

54
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.280
Each backup policy
consists of a snapshot time

55
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.260
and one or more policy items.

56
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.800
The backup policy time
specifies the time of day in UTC

57
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.650
that Atlas takes a snapshot
for the backup policy.

58
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.350
Snapshots taken for
the Hourly policy item

59
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.180
may occur multiple
times each day

60
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.550
depending on the frequency
interval specified.

61
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.520
Each backup policy item
specifies a frequency unit

62
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.840
and an interval and
a retention time.

63
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.020
For example, the
default backup policy

64
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.620
specifies a snapshot
time of 1800 UTC,

65
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.960
an Hourly snapshot with
an interval of one hour

66
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.660
and a retention of two
days, daily snapshots

67
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.360
with a retention of seven
days, weekly snapshots

68
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.690
with an interval of Saturday
and a retention of four days,

69
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.520
and monthly snapshots
with an interval

70
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.420
of the last day of the month
and a retention of 12 months.

71
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.360
So another improvement to our
cloud provider snapshot feature

72
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.660
is the ability to encrypt your
Cloud Provider Snapshots using

73
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.920
your own KMIP server.

74
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.170
This effectively means that
you can bring your own key

75
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.300
to encrypt and
decrypt your backups

76
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.268
through the configured KMS
service for the Atlas project.

77
00:02:57.268 --> 00:02:59.310
As we recently added this
feature to Google Cloud

78
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.450
Platform, this is now supported
across all three cloud

79
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.990
providers.

80
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.030
So let's recap.

81
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.920
Atlas now supports
incremental backups

82
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.380
on Google Cloud
Platform and AWS.

83
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.200
You can now perform cross-region
backups on all three cloud

84
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.710
providers, and you can also
integrate your own KMIP server

85
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.890
and use your own key to encrypt
and decrypt your Cloud Provider

86
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.740
Snapshots.
