00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.288


2
00:00:00.288 --> 00:00:02.830
In this lesson, we're going to
discuss a new feature in Atlas

3
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.960
called the Sample Data Set.

4
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.940
Atlas now exposes
some sample data

5
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.070
that you can load
directly into Atlas

6
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.170
for users who want to
explore data immediately

7
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.060
after creating their cluster.

8
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.460
Some users create Atlas
clusters for production use,

9
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.250
and they know exactly what
data they want to work with.

10
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.080
Those users might
already have their data

11
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.390
in a bsondump or a JSON file.

12
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.980
So they can use the
command-line tools

13
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.900
mongorestore and mongoimport
to load that data into Atlas.

14
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.280
And until this release,
those command-line tools

15
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.920
were the only means of
getting data into Atlas.

16
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.980
But this requires users
to leave the Atlas site,

17
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.590
open a terminal window or
command prompt, and then use

18
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.610
a command-line tool, which
can be time consuming.

19
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.820
Another caveat of using
the command-line tools

20
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.440
is that you already
have some sample

21
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.420
data that you want to import.

22
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.400
Finding good sample
data, the kind

23
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.572
that facilitates exploration,
can be difficult.

24
00:00:52.572 --> 00:00:54.530
And we want to make sure
users can explore data

25
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.060
right off the bat.

26
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.590
So we've released
a new feature that

27
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.470
allows users to load a sample
data set into Atlas directly

28
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.210
from the Atlas UI.

29
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.830
This sample data set
was curated internally,

30
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.760
and it's intended to give users
a decently large-sized data set

31
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.100
to play around with.

32
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.980
So we can load the
sample data set as soon

33
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.210
as we've created a cluster.

34
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.660
If we navigate to
the Collections tab,

35
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.640
Atlas will notice that
there's no data in here,

36
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.330
and it'll give us two options.

37
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.230
The first is to load the sample
data set into our cluster,

38
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.720
and the other option will allow
us to manually create data

39
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.300
using the Atlas Data Explorer.

40
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.950
Choosing to load
the sample data set

41
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.440
shows us this modal,
which has a link

42
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.050
to the docs page explaining
the different collections

43
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.880
in the sample data set.

44
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.980
And this docs page is
very detailed with respect

45
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.020
to sample documents
from the collection,

46
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.075
the indexes in each collection.

47
00:01:43.075 --> 00:01:45.623
If we look in the
Airbnb listings,

48
00:01:45.623 --> 00:01:47.290
we can see the indexes
that have already

49
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.650
been created on this data set
as well as a sample document

50
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.943
from the collection.

51
00:01:51.943 --> 00:01:53.860
So we can actually learn
a bit about this data

52
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.480
before we even import it.

53
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.710
But we're just doing some
exploration on free tier

54
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.628
so we can load this
without actually worrying.

55
00:01:59.628 --> 00:02:01.420
So here, I'm just going
to click the option

56
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.366
to load the sample data set.

57
00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:05.910
It should take a minute.

58
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.410
So after loading
the data set, we

59
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.630
can immediately explore the
data using the Atlas Data

60
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.600
Explorer, which is very similar
to the interface provided

61
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.430
by Compass.

62
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.200
One of the reasons
this is so powerful

63
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.110
is because it allows us to
start exploring data in MongoDB

64
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.978
without ever leaving
the Atlas site.

65
00:02:20.978 --> 00:02:23.520
And if we get the motivation to
write some application backed

66
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.260
by this Atlas
cluster, we'll already

67
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.850
know a bit about this data.

68
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.620
This data set
contains a diverse set

69
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.200
of data spanning a few
different industries, including

70
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.050
movies in the mflix data set,
weather in the weatherdata data

71
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.580
set, and housing data
in the Airbnb data set.

72
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.580
The collections contain
a few different document

73
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.710
shapes with varying
degrees of complexity

74
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.070
and just about every data
type that we allow in MongoDB.

75
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.800
This data set is intended to
be a playground for newcomers

76
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.162
or really anyone interested
in exploring data on MongoDB.

77
00:02:54.162 --> 00:02:56.620
We hope that it will cultivate
the kind of exploration that

78
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.500
excites users about MongoDB
without ever leaving their web

79
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.740
browser.

80
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.100
So just to recap, this
new sample data set

81
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.680
can be loaded directly
from the Atlas website,

82
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.170
mitigating the need for
a command-line tool.

83
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.950
The data set is intended to
facilitate data explorations,

84
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.700
so it contains a few
different collections

85
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.310
that vary in
industry, data types,

86
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.760
as well as document shapes.
