1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.152


2
00:00:00.152 --> 00:00:01.610
In this lesson,
we're going to look

3
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.610
at the new geospatial chart
types available in MongoDB

4
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.655
Charts.

5
00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:07.280
So these charts are
a great way for you

6
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.460
to gain quick and visual
insights into your data stored

7
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.980
inside MongoDB.

8
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.650
MongoDB documents have a
rich set of data types,

9
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.590
such as dates, subdocuments,
arrays, Decimal128, and others

10
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.770
to provide data precision
and data affinity with what

11
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.490
that information represents
and how the application works

12
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.050
with that same data.

13
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.630
One of those rich data
types is the ability

14
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.970
to store geolocation
data, and there

15
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.800
are several different
types of analysis

16
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.650
that one can do using
geospatial fields.

17
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.140
Charts is built to
natively support and work

18
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.500
with the MongoDB document
model, and it connects directly

19
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.570
to your MongoDB cluster.

20
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.050
This means that we do not need
to go through ETL operations

21
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.570
to convert or
format data, or use

22
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.810
different connectors to
integrate with other BI tools.

23
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.390
Let's jump into the Charts UI
and have a look at the three

24
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.470
different type of
geospatial charts

25
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.440
we've added in this
latest release of Charts.

26
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.980
So from the Atlas UI,
let's jump into Charts

27
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.180
and create a geospatial chart.

28
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.670
So we have our m042 dashboard.

29
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.690
Let's open that up
and add a chart.

30
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.410
And as we're going to be looking
at our geospatial charts,

31
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.390
we're going to create
a geospatial chart

32
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.680
from the dropdown
and select Heatmap.

33
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.790
So we need to select our
data source from the top,

34
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.080
and we're going to use our
sample_airbnb data set.

35
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.450
And we're interested
in the address field.

36
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.810
So let's drag our location
onto the coordinates plane.

37
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.800
And for intensity, we're
going to use the price.

38
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.190


39
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.455
And we're going to
select the mean price.

40
00:01:52.455 --> 00:01:55.890


41
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.930
That's a lot of
information, so let's say

42
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.500
we wanted to filter down
by a suburb in New York.

43
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.330
Let's have a look at
how we can do that.

44
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.280
So we add a filter, go back up
to our address, subdocument,

45
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.280
and select suburb.

46
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.870
Let's drag suburb
onto the Filter field.

47
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.090
And you can see, we have quite a
few suburbs all over the world.

48
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.660
So we'll deselect
all the suburbs

49
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.630
and let's have a
look at Brooklyn.

50
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.690
Great.

51
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.540
Here you can see we've
got a heatmap of all

52
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.110
the most expensive Airbnb
listings in Brooklyn

53
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.130
in New York.

54
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.540
It's pretty impressive, right?

55
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.290
Let's have a look at
the other chart types

56
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.550
and see what we can do.

57
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.470
So as we said, our heatmap
shows the most expensive areas

58
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.200
to rent an Airbnb in Brooklyn.

59
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.910
That's really nice,
but what if we

60
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.640
want to get more detail
on what type of rentals

61
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.100
we have in this data
and their price?

62
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.840
For that, we can
use a scatter chart.

63
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.450
So let's add a new chart.

64
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.300
Again, we're going
to select Geospatial.

65
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.015
And this time, we're going
to use a Scatter chart.

66
00:02:57.015 --> 00:02:59.200
We need to select our
data set, which is

67
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.580
our Airbnb.listingsAndReviews.

68
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.100
and again, we're interested
in the address field.

69
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.410
So we're going to drag the
location onto Coordinates.

70
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.840
And we want our color to
indicate the number of bedrooms

71
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.350
in a listing.

72
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.590
So let's drag the number
of bedrooms onto Color.

73
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.380


74
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.080
And we want the size
to indicate the price,

75
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.600
so let's drag the price
field onto the Size.

76
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.720


77
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.830
OK, so we've got a wide
range of documents here,

78
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.990
and you might
notice that we have

79
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.940
a little message of
the top that says,

80
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.950
The maximum query
response is 1,000.

81
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.390
So let's go again and
filter by address.

82
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.190
So we'll drag
suburb onto Filter.

83
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.960
And again, we can see we've
got suburbs all over the world.

84
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.950
So if we deselect them
and select Brooklyn,

85
00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.470
so now we've got
a map which shows

86
00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.190
all the listings in
Brooklyn, and their price

87
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.650
is indicated by the size of
the circle on the scatter plot.

88
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.650
You may notice that we
only have properties here

89
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.337
listed with zero bedrooms.

90
00:04:08.337 --> 00:04:09.420
So that's not quite right.

91
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.962
So let's turn the BINNING off.

92
00:04:11.962 --> 00:04:13.670
And there you can see
that we have a list

93
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.829
from 0 to 4 for bedrooms, and
the size of all these circles

94
00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.180
indicates the price.

95
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.400
And when we hover over
each individual listing,

96
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.860
charts will pop up and
give us more detail

97
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.680
on that actual listing or that
actual geopoint in our data.

98
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.970
That's pretty cool.

99
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.180
So this is really
useful information.

100
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.180
We can very clearly see the
amount of rooms and properties

101
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.170
available on the map.

102
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.680
There are a lot of properties
on Airbnb globally.

103
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.130
What if we wanted to see where
all of those properties were

104
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.260
and how many properties
were in each country?

105
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.230
Let's use the sample
data set in Atlas again.

106
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.840
And this time, we're going to
see how many properties are

107
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.030
in each region of the world.

108
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.910
To do this, we're going to
use the choropleth map, which

109
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.090
is basically a fancy
way of saying that we're

110
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.210
going to color countries.

111
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.240
So let's go back out
to our dashboard.

112
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.810
So this time, we're going
to create a choropleth.

113
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.320
So again, select
Geospatial, Choropleth.

114
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.900
We're going to select
our Airbnb data source

115
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.640
and all the fields
will load in the left.

116
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.110
So we're going to use the
address.county country field

117
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.280
and drag that onto Location.

118
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.320
And we're going to use
the _id value for Color.

119
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.540
We're going to use a
count of that value.

120
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.910
We're sure the _id is
unique in every collection,

121
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.230
so we can reliably use this as
a count for all the properties

122
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.640
listed around the world.

123
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.700
There are obviously a lot of
listings on Airbnb globally,

124
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.210
but from this map, we only have
a subset of those listings.

125
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.750
We can see that if we
hover over each country,

126
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.340
we will be given a map
of the amount of Airbnb

127
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.260
listings in that country.

128
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.190
That's really cool.

129
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.565
But this is just
a sample of what

130
00:05:52.565 --> 00:05:56.268
you can do with the new
geospatial maps in Charts.

131
00:05:56.268 --> 00:05:57.810
You can see that
these visualizations

132
00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.450
can be very powerful for
insights into your data.

133
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.880
And best of all, it's
very easy and quick

134
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.740
to generate these charts.

135
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.930
This is just an example
of the information

136
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.215
you can easily
visualize from your data

137
00:06:09.215 --> 00:06:11.430
in MongoDB using charts.

138
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.430
There's a lot more functionality
for you to explore.

139
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.260
The great news is that
you can experiment

140
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.070
with Charts for free on your
free tier Atlas cluster.

141
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.260
So let's recap.

142
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.860
Charts now allows you to
create three new chart types--

143
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.790
heat map, scatter,
and choropleth.

144
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.840
And best of all, you can
explore this in Atlas

145
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.090
using your free tier cluster and
the sample data sets provided.
