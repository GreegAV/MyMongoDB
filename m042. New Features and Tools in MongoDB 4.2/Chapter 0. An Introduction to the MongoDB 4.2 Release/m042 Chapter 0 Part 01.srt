00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.030
Hello.

3
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.900
My name is Matt.

4
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.525
And in this lesson,
we're going to look

5
00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:06.317
at the virtual environment
for this course M042.

6
00:00:06.317 --> 00:00:07.900
So throughout this
course, we're going

7
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.092
to show examples of the new
features in MongoDB 4.2.

8
00:00:11.092 --> 00:00:13.675
And we want to give you a way
of testing out these features so

9
00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:15.490
that you can feel
comfortable using them.

10
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.100
So one option is to spin
up a replica set locally

11
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.392
and then follow along lessons
on your local machine.

12
00:00:20.392 --> 00:00:22.600
If you feel comfortable
doing this, you should do it.

13
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.933
But you should bear in mind
that in order for everything

14
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:28.240
to run locally you need to have
the dependencies installed as

15
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.490
well as the necessary
handout files to follow along

16
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.717
with the lesson.

17
00:00:31.717 --> 00:00:33.550
This is all possible,
as we'll provide links

18
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.430
to download dependencies
and distribute the handouts.

19
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.560
But there is an easier solution.

20
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.900
Using the virtual machine
for this course, called

21
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.390
m042-vagrant-env, we can
download and provision

22
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.090
an environment that
already contains

23
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.410
the necessary dependencies
for this course

24
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.440
as well as any handout files.

25
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.410
In this case, we would call
the VM the guest machine.

26
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.080
And we refer to our local
machine as the host machine.

27
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.450
Once we provision the
VM, we can start up

28
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.480
a replica set without needing
to download anything else.

29
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.260
In addition, using the course VM
helps MongoDB university staff

30
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.967
such as myself diagnose
and debug potential issues,

31
00:01:09.967 --> 00:01:12.050
because we're very familiar
with this environment,

32
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.300
and we may not be as familiar
with your local machine.

33
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.260
So without further ado, let's
take a look inside the VM.

34
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.750
So I'm just going to make a
new directory for this course

35
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.730
and then cd into it.

36
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.160
So I just downloaded
the VM from the handouts

37
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.310
on the university site, and now
it's in my Downloads folder.

38
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.430
So I'm just going to copy
it into my m042 folder here.

39
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.840
So now I'm inside the VM
folder m042-vagrant-env,

40
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.210
and there are only two
files in here to start out--

41
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.150
the Vagrantfile, which contains
some of the baseline hardware

42
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.940
configurations for the VM
and the provisioning file

43
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.790
as a shell script that downloads
all the necessary dependencies

44
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.570
and files for this course.

45
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.590
So using this command, I can
bring the VM up and then run

46
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.267
the provisioning file
in one fell swoop.

47
00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:56.100
So we have to wait a
minute for this to run.

48
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.892
But when it's done, it
should read "Welcome

49
00:01:57.892 --> 00:02:00.020
to M042 Vagrant Box."

50
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.610
If we see that
message, we'll know

51
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.068
that the machine was booted
up, and the provisioning script

52
00:02:04.068 --> 00:02:05.230
ran successfully.

53
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.980
So now we can log into
the Vagrant machine

54
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.722
with SSH using the
command vagrant ssh.

55
00:02:09.722 --> 00:02:11.180
And we can see the
shell prompt has

56
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.597
changed to reflect that we're
now logged in to the Vagrant

57
00:02:13.597 --> 00:02:14.570
machine.

58
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.120
So remember, our provisioning
script already downloaded

59
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.020
MongoDB.

60
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.217
So we can spin up a
mongod process immediately

61
00:02:20.217 --> 00:02:21.800
after logging into
the Vagrant machine

62
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.570
for the very first time.

63
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.415
I can connect to the
database I just started.

64
00:02:26.415 --> 00:02:28.040
I'm just going to
shut down this server

65
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.290
so I can start up a new one.

66
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.410
So now I've just shut down
that database process,

67
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.313
and I've exited from
the Mongo shell,

68
00:02:34.313 --> 00:02:36.730
so that I can start up a new
database process that's bound

69
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.690
to a different IP address.

70
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.510
So the guest VM
has been configured

71
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.970
to be accessed on the IP
address 192.168.42.100.

72
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.460
So if you want to access this
mongod server from your host

73
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.005
machine, you need to bind your
Mongo ID to that IP address.

74
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.710
So now that that's
started successfully,

75
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.525
I'm actually just going to
exit the Vagrant machine.

76
00:02:56.525 --> 00:02:58.400
So now I'm connected
back to my host machine.

77
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.520
But the mongod process is still
running inside the guest VM.

78
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.580
I can connect to
that mongod process

79
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.640
using the IP address of the VM.

80
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.940
The --host flag allows us to
specify a network interface

81
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.290
where mongod is running.

82
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.660
And I started that process
in the default port,

83
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.570
so all I need to do is
specify a host here.

84
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.240
So one reason you might want
to connect to the guest VM

85
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.878
from your host machine
is if you wanted

86
00:03:20.878 --> 00:03:23.170
to connect with Compass,
which was running on your host

87
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.030
machine, to a
mongod process that

88
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.090
was running inside the
guest machine or the VM.

89
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.270
So to do this, we can just
specify the same hostname here

90
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.190
and the connection
credentials on Compass.

91
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.056
And then we should
be able to connect.

92
00:03:35.056 --> 00:03:36.980
I'm just going to
connect back to Vagrant

93
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.290
with SSH very quickly to
show you one more thing.

94
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.080
So when the home
directory of Vagrant,

95
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.600
which is the directory it'll
direct you to as you first

96
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.330
connect, there's this folder
in the home directory called

97
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.310
Shared.

98
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.720
Now, this folder is what we
call a synced folder, which

99
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.357
means that it's synced
to your host machine.

100
00:03:53.357 --> 00:03:54.940
When you bring up
the Vagrant machine,

101
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.820
there are actually two Shared
folders that get created.

102
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.010
The first gets created
on your host machine,

103
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.877
and the second gets created
inside the Vagrant machine.

104
00:04:02.877 --> 00:04:04.460
These two folders
are linked together.

105
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.370
So you can share documents
between your host

106
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.710
machine and your course VM.

107
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.130
If you place any file on one
of these folders or remove one,

108
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.454
that change will be reflected
in the other folder.

109
00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.329
So be careful, because
you could accidentally

110
00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.250
delete things from
your host machine

111
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.140
while you're still in the VM.

112
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.029
So that concludes our
lesson on Vagrant.

113
00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.820
Just to recap, the
virtual environment

114
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.320
is used to mitigate the need
to download course dependencies

115
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.740
on your local machine.

116
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.547
The VM will come with
everything pre-installed.

117
00:04:30.547 --> 00:04:32.380
If you want to share
files between your host

118
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.220
system and your VM, the Shared
folder will help you do that.

119
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.370
Lastly, Vagrant is
optional in this course,

120
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.523
as there is no homework.

121
00:04:39.523 --> 00:04:41.190
So if you want to use
your local machine

122
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.960
to test out the new
features, please feel free.

123
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.790
But this approach is
most likely easier.
