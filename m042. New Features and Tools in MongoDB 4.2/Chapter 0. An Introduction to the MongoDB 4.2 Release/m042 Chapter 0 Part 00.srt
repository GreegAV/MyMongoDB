00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.050
Hi there, and welcome to
M042: New Features and Tools

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.730
in MongoDB 4.2.

4
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.670
One of our classics around
here at MongoDB University.

5
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.760
In this course, we'll be
looking to all the new features

6
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.640
that we have assembled for
you in the MongoDB 4.2 server

7
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.220
release and the tools
that are made available

8
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.410
around this release cycle.

9
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.060
And what do we have for
you this time around?

10
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.900
Well, a bunch of cool new stuff.

11
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.790
On the server side,
the main feature

12
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.120
we are going to be releasing
is sharded transactions.

13
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.950
Multi-document
transaction support

14
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.870
across sharded clusters.

15
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.850
You will get a deep
dive explanation

16
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.450
on how sharded transactions
work and the benefits regarding

17
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.910
the management of shard
keys, for example,

18
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.590
that come associated
with the support

19
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.310
of sharded transactions.

20
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.500
But there is more.

21
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.770
MongoDB 4.2 brings a
complete new index built

22
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.690
system and a new index type.

23
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.010
MongoDB 4.2 also introduces
a more expressive update

24
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.640
operator, the new dollar merge
aggregation pipeline stage

25
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.490
that allows for powerful
on-demand materialized view

26
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.820
mechanisms, and a set of
new aggregation pipeline

27
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.320
expressions.

28
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.170
On our tools front, we'll
be looking to improvements

29
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.470
and advances around Ops Manager
backup flows, each agent

30
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.310
support, new
organizations API access,

31
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.660
and the general availability
of our MongoDB enterprise

32
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.570
Kubernetes Operator for all of
you container people out there.

33
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.910
Regarding the cloud
offering, we'll

34
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.100
be introducing a
brand new product that

35
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.510
will enable the analysis of data
stored in S3 buckets or archive

36
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.050
data using the MongoDB query
language and the aggregation

37
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.890
framework.

38
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.860
Charts got a new set
of exciting features

39
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.250
like new geospatial charts
types and the ability

40
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.010
to embed charts directly
into your mobile application.

41
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.000
So a lot of new exciting
stuff to look for.

42
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.470
But let's talk logistics.

43
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.050
In this course we want
to focus your attention

44
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.360
on the new features and
products and remove away

45
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.990
any emphasis on completing
homework and assignments.

46
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.880
This means that we
are not going to have

47
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.820
you go through a final exam
or any graded assignments

48
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.060
in this course.

49
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.720
We still want you to follow
along with lecture material

50
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.800
and be able to experiment with
all the new server versions

51
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.750
and the new release tools.

52
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.840
Therefore, we will be making
available a virtual machine

53
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.870
supported by Vagrant
so you can play around

54
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.630
with all of those new
exciting features,

55
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.090
intellectual material in
an isolated environment

56
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.720
containing all the necessary
dependencies pre-installed.

57
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.430
That said, it is
completely optional.

58
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.690
You can, if you choose to,
install all the new features

59
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.090
and tools in your workstation.

60
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.800
In this lesson
lecture notes you will

61
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.640
find a full list of dependencies
and installation instructions

62
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.290
necessary for this course.

63
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.590
The VM is for your
convenience only.

64
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.360
The goal of this
course is for you

65
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.140
to have a clear understanding
of all these new features

66
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.960
introduced in MongoDB
4.2, have a view of how

67
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.360
these new tools help you
become more effective,

68
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.550
and expand the possible
usage of MongoDB

69
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.980
across a variety of
different use cases.

70
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.200
With all that
said, welcome, hope

71
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.690
you enjoy and get to
learn all the new features

72
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.640
and functionality
we prepared for you.

73
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.790
And I'll see you in class.
