1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,400
Currently MongoDB enforces
and 1,024 byte index key size

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,980
limit on all indexes created.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,120
That is to say that if any
value for a key in the index

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,210
exceeds this limit the
index build would fail.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,250
In other words,
you could not index

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,370
on fields whose values
exceeded this size limit.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,680
This limit also applies
to a combination

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,660
of fields in a compound index.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,730
That is to say that
if the combined

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,190
values of the fields
in a compound index

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,780
exceed 1,024 bytes the
index build will fail.

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,840
You may be happy to hear that
this limitation is going away

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,000
in version 4.2.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,160
Our motivation for
this change are

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,340
that there are certain use cases
where having fields exceeding

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,590
this limit are a requirement.

18
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,730
Up until now it has not been
possible to create indexes

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,710
on any field that
contain the value that

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,110
exceeded 1,024 bytes.

21
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,210
This could be problematic
for data sets which

22
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,200
have long string values.

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,320
Another reason
for this change is

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,840
to facilitate a new index type.

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,210
This index type,
named Wild Card,

26
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,350
allows you to easily index
all fields in a document.

27
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,720
To use this new index
we needed to be sure

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,420
that users would not have
to worry about a field

29
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,150
hitting this limit and making
their index build fail.

30
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,520
So in summary, MongoDB 4.2
removes the index key size

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,270
limit.

32
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,420
You can now index on any
key, regardless of the size

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:00:00,000
of the values it contains.
