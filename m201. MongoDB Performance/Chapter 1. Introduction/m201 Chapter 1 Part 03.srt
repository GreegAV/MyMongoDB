00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320


2
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.040
Let's discuss the
content that is going

3
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.910
to be covered in this course.

4
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.670
Other than the
overview chapter, there

5
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.330
are four main chapters
on performance, Indexes,

6
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.240
Index Operations,
CRUD Optimizations,

7
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.040
and Performance on Clusters.

8
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.350
In the first
chapter, Indexes, you

9
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.550
learn how indexes
are a critical part

10
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.880
of providing efficient
access to the data that

11
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.480
lives in your database.

12
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.570
Here, you'll learn
about what indexes

13
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.030
are, how both indexes
and other data

14
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.960
are stored on disk, the most
common types of indexes, how we

15
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.690
can optimize sorting
through the use of indexes,

16
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.910
and the different types
of secondary indexes

17
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.710
and their properties.

18
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.920
After we've covered what indexes
are, in the second chapter,

19
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.540
we'll then discuss
how we practically

20
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.030
work with these indexes.

21
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.850
Here, we'll discuss how to
build, discover, delete,

22
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.980
and rebalance indexes, query
plans, the explain method, how

23
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.000
to use hint and index filters,
how indexes impact our servers

24
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.310
resources, and
finally, we'll examine

25
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.190
some basic benchmarking.

26
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.644
We'll then dig into chapter
3, CRUD Optimizations,

27
00:01:04.644 --> 00:01:06.810
where we'll talk about what
other factors can affect

28
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.300
performance, as
well as how indexes

29
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.190
can interact with your queries.

30
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.380
Here, we're going to
examine optimizing

31
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.750
your CRUD optimizations, covered
queries, regular expressions,

32
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.860
insert performance, index fields
with a mixture of data types,

33
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.620
and last we'll take a look
at how indexes interact

34
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.070
with the aggregation pipeline.

35
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.460
In the last chapter, we'll
talk about distributed systems.

36
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.770
Here, you're going to
learn about performance

37
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.040
considerations in a
distributed system,

38
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.040
increasing write performance
with sharding, reading

39
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.530
from secondaries in
your replica sets,

40
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.170
replica sets with
specialized indexes,

41
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.630
and finally, we'll discuss how
to optimize your aggregation

42
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.280
pipeline.

43
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.804
That's a great overview of
the content in this course.

44
00:01:51.804 --> 00:01:53.720
Now that you know what
we're going to discuss,

45
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.720
let's get started.
