00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.340
Hi I'm Kirby.

3
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.830
Welcome to M 2 0 1
MongoDB performance.

4
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.340
Highly performant
database architectures

5
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.980
are a key condition of
mission critical software

6
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.390
infrastructure.

7
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.059
Throughout this course we're
going to discuss performance

8
00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.980
in the context of MongoDB.

9
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.840
This course is
five chapters long,

10
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.760
with each chapter there will
be a new set of lesson videos.

11
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.320
After most of these
videos there'll

12
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.470
be a quiz to assess your
learning of the material.

13
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.040
At the end of each
chapter, there

14
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.360
will also be a set of
related lab exercises.

15
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.360
Let's go over a few
logistics of this course.

16
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.727
Target audience.

17
00:00:38.727 --> 00:00:40.810
This is an intermediate
course suitable for people

18
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.560
on both the development
and operations teams.

19
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.840
It is expected that you have
some basic understanding

20
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.400
of databases.

21
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.970
How does grading work?

22
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.840
Well, there are quizzes,
labs, and a final exam

23
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.820
as deliverables on your
part of the course.

24
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.010
Quizzes are ungraded and
exist to make sure you're

25
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.816
understanding the content.

26
00:01:00.816 --> 00:01:02.190
Your grade in the
class, however,

27
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.370
will be based on how
well you do on the labs

28
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.940
and on the final exam.

29
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.830
Each of these being worth
about 50% of your final grade.

30
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.620
Students who receive
a 65% or greater

31
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.650
will receive a passing grade
and will receive a certificate

32
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.650
of course completion.

33
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.500
Finally I'd highly
encourage you to participate

34
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.300
in our discussion forum.

35
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.640
We have knowledgeable teaching
assistants who are there

36
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.350
to help answer your questions.

37
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.630
And you also have
your fellow classmates

38
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.370
who can aid in
answering your questions

39
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.300
and are often very knowledgeable
and helpful resources.

40
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.310
Based on our
experience, we've seen

41
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.230
that students who perform
best in the course

42
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.700
are often those who are very
active in the discussion forum.

43
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.000
This course will be divided
into five main chapters.

44
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.210
There's the Overview chapter,
Indexes Index Operations,

45
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.940
CRUD Optimization, and
Distributed Systems.

46
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.030
Each of these topics
will take a deep dive

47
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.680
into one or more
performance related

48
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.690
aspects concerning MongoDB.

49
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.340
By the end of this
course, you should

50
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.650
be familiar with the
different techniques used

51
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.680
to increase the performance
of your MongoDB servers.

52
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.470
And you should be capable of
analyzing the different trade

53
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.300
offs that are
commonly encountered

54
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.730
in different
performance scenarios.

55
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.590
With all that being
said, we're super

56
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.210
excited to have
you in this course

57
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.510
and wish you the best of luck.
