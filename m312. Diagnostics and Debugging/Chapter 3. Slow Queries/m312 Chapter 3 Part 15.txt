Let's see how we can do the same with Compass.

There isn't a Compass for Linux as of this recording.

And we're running a headless VM, anyway.

So I'll exit and run this on my host machine.

First, I'll need to connect.

I've got my system setup to forward ports 30,000 30,001, and 30,002 from my VM onto my host machine.

So I'm going to be looking at the same data here that I have in the virtual machine.

Great.

We're connected.

Now let's go to m312.people.

And we'll click on the Indexes tab.

Great.

This page is presenting me with a view-- well, a much prettier view-- of my current indexes, but with a lot of cool additional stats.

For purposes of this lesson, what we're interested in is this green button, Create Index.

The first thing that we see is that we don't have to remember all the options when creating indexes.

They're right there in front of us, including the Build Index and the Background option.

If you want to name the index, go ahead.

Otherwise, you'll get the default name constructed by the field names and types.

Note that you can also name your index in the shell, but I rarely do that.

Let's add the field address.city of type Ascending.

We'll create it in the background.

And we click Create.

That's it.

We can see the new index in the list.

This is obviously much easier than the command line interface.
