1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.650
Now at the other extreme,
the opposite event

3
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.771
can also cause sudden problems,
an unexpected index build.

4
00:00:06.771 --> 00:00:08.770
If you're building an
index, your storage engine

5
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.590
needs to create a
lot of index entries.

6
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.150
This will be a
blocking operation.

7
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.016
And depending on the size of
the index, it could take time.

8
00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.890
Your server won't take
rights while the index

9
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:28.499
is getting built.

10
00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:29.415
We'll create an index.

11
00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:31.869


12
00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:32.910
Then we'll go to the log.

13
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.050


14
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.207
Here you can see
the index build.

15
00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:42.040
And if you look at the
start and stop times,

16
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.810
you can figure out
how long it took.

17
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.310
Obviously, it didn't
take long here,

18
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.730
since I just spun up my replica
set and everything was empty.

19
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.500
If you can catch an
index build in action,

20
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.500
you can also find it
with db.currentOp.

21
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.600
But once an index
build is in progress,

22
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.890
you've already got a problem.

23
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.264
And by the time
you connect, it's

24
00:00:58.264 --> 00:01:00.100
probably going to be done with.

25
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.170
But maybe you really
need to build an index.

26
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.780
And maybe you can't afford
to take the performance hit

27
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.140
while an index is getting built.
What are your alternatives?

28
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.400
They basically all
come down to planning.

29
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.070
We'll cover this in detail in
our lesson on building indexes.
