Now that we've done all the heavy work, let's have a look at the preferred method, the rolling upgrade.

This time, we're going to leverage the MongoDB management tools to do this.

Using Cloud Manager, we're going to build a new index in a rolling upgrade fashion, just like we covered a moment ago.

If you have Ops Manager, this feature is also available to you.

From this page, you want to click on the Modify button on the replica set line and scroll down to the Index Configuration section.

We'll click Add and add our index.

Will put it in the m312.people namespace.

We'll put it on the address.city, address.zip fields.

We click Apply, Review & Deploy, Confirm & Deploy, and that's it.

I just have to wait for Cloud Manager to do a rolling upgrade for me.

If this isn't a production system, building on the primary in the foreground should do just fine.

If you have your cluster managed under Ops Manager or Cloud Manager, use that to build your indexes.

If you don't have those systems and you have a window of time where performance isn't at its peak, you can use that time to build the index in the background.

And if you have a primary under stress and can't afford to add any load to it, use the manual rolling upgrade procedure.

And those are your options for building indexes.
