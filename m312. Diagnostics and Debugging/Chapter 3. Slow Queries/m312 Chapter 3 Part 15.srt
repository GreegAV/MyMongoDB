1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.499


2
00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.830
Let's see how we can do
the same with Compass.

3
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.840
There isn't a Compass for
Linux as of this recording.

4
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.540
And we're running a
headless VM, anyway.

5
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.270
So I'll exit and run
this on my host machine.

6
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.660
First, I'll need to connect.

7
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.710
I've got my system setup to
forward ports 30,000 30,001,

8
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.140
and 30,002 from my VM
onto my host machine.

9
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.960
So I'm going to be
looking at the same data

10
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.960
here that I have in
the virtual machine.

11
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.970


12
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:29.620
Great.

13
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.740
We're connected.

14
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.560
Now let's go to m312.people.

15
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.320
And we'll click on
the Indexes tab.

16
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.040
Great.

17
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.870
This page is presenting
me with a view--

18
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.570
well, a much prettier view--
of my current indexes,

19
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.880
but with a lot of
cool additional stats.

20
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.370
For purposes of this lesson,
what we're interested in

21
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.347
is this green
button, Create Index.

22
00:00:49.347 --> 00:00:50.930
The first thing that
we see is that we

23
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.780
don't have to remember all the
options when creating indexes.

24
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.238
They're right there
in front of us,

25
00:00:55.238 --> 00:00:58.310
including the Build Index
and the Background option.

26
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.277
If you want to name
the index, go ahead.

27
00:01:00.277 --> 00:01:02.360
Otherwise, you'll get the
default name constructed

28
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.310
by the field names and types.

29
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.500
Note that you can also name
your index in the shell,

30
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.900
but I rarely do that.

31
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.410
Let's add the field
address.city of type Ascending.

32
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.610
We'll create it
in the background.

33
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.290
And we click Create.

34
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.040
That's it.

35
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.620
We can see the new
index in the list.

36
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.260
This is obviously much
easier than the command line

37
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.110
interface.
