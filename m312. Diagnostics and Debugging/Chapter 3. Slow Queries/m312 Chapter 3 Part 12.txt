Let's go back into our VM.

And let's look at our last tool, mlogvis.

This tool is very similar to mplotqueries.

But the tool was created later and doesn't require the graphical libraries used by mplotqueries.

Instead, it produces an HTML file in your local directory and points your browser to it.

If the tool is unable to open the default browser in your system, you can open the file yourself from the browser.

I'm in the VM in the shared folder.

So I can switch out of the VM and open it on my desktop machine if I like.

The nice thing about this behavior is that you can create the output file from one system with the minus minus no-browser option and move it to another one for analysis or send it to someone who doesn't have mtools installed at all because this HTML file doesn't require anything, just a browser.

Similar to the other tools, we'll simply call mlogvis by passing it our mongod.log file.

And now I've got this HTML file.

I'll go to this on my host machine and open it up.

Just like before, we can zoom in on the graph.

First, we select Zoom and then draw a rectangle on the area of interest.

And like our previous tool, I can toggle the collections I'm looking at and look at individual slow queries by clicking on the event.

When you do so, you can see the corresponding query in the status box at the bottom.

The UI is simple and intuitive.

So feel free to play with it.

In summary, these tools are particularly helpful for identifying and visualizing slow queries.
