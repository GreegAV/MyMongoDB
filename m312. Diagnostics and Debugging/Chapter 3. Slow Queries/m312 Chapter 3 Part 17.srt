1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.176


2
00:00:00.176 --> 00:00:01.800
Now that we've done
all the heavy work,

3
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.560
let's have a look at the
preferred method, the rolling

4
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.120
upgrade.

5
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.060
This time, we're going to
leverage the MongoDB management

6
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.920
tools to do this.

7
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.350
Using Cloud Manager, we're
going to build a new index

8
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.360
in a rolling upgrade
fashion, just

9
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.310
like we covered a moment ago.

10
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.990
If you have Ops
Manager, this feature

11
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.571
is also available to you.

12
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:23.820
From this page, you want to
click on the Modify button

13
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.520
on the replica set line and
scroll down to the Index

14
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.360
Configuration section.

15
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.970
We'll click Add
and add our index.

16
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.230
Will put it in the
m312.people namespace.

17
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.240
We'll put it on the
address.city, address.zip

18
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.450
fields.

19
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.070
We click Apply, Review &
Deploy, Confirm & Deploy,

20
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.370
and that's it.

21
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.930
I just have to wait
for Cloud Manager

22
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.210
to do a rolling upgrade for me.

23
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.160
If this isn't a
production system,

24
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.610
building on the primary in the
foreground should do just fine.

25
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.490
If you have your cluster managed
under Ops Manager or Cloud

26
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.460
Manager, use that to
build your indexes.

27
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.280
If you don't have those systems
and you have a window of time

28
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.200
where performance
isn't at its peak,

29
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.410
you can use that time to build
the index in the background.

30
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.270
And if you have a
primary under stress

31
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.250
and can't afford to
add any load to it,

32
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.010
use the manual rolling
upgrade procedure.

33
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.970
And those are your options
for building indexes.
