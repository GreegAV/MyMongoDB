1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.660
Let's go back into our VM.

3
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.620
And let's look at our
last tool, mlogvis.

4
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.320
This tool is very
similar to mplotqueries.

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.420
But the tool was created
later and doesn't

6
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.600
require the graphical
libraries used by mplotqueries.

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.930
Instead, it produces an HTML
file in your local directory

8
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.710
and points your browser to it.

9
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.530
If the tool is unable
to open the default

10
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.050
browser in your system, you
can open the file yourself

11
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.340
from the browser.

12
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm in the VM in
the shared folder.

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.030
So I can switch out
of the VM and open it

14
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.760
on my desktop machine if I like.

15
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.200
The nice thing
about this behavior

16
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.960
is that you can create the
output file from one system

17
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.970
with the minus minus
no-browser option

18
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.040
and move it to another
one for analysis

19
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.530
or send it to someone who
doesn't have mtools installed

20
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.710
at all because this HTML file
doesn't require anything, just

21
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.976
a browser.

22
00:00:46.976 --> 00:00:48.350
Similar to the
other tools, we'll

23
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.040
simply call mlogvis by passing
it our mongod.log file.

24
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.020
And now I've got this HTML file.

25
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.550
I'll go to this on my host
machine and open it up.

26
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.430
Just like before, we can
zoom in on the graph.

27
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.670
First, we select Zoom
and then draw a rectangle

28
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.040
on the area of interest.

29
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.810
And like our
previous tool, I can

30
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.930
toggle the collections
I'm looking at

31
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.700
and look at individual
slow queries

32
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.940
by clicking on the event.

33
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.430
When you do so, you can
see the corresponding query

34
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.990
in the status box at the bottom.

35
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.850
The UI is simple and intuitive.

36
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.010
So feel free to play with it.

37
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.080
In summary, these
tools are particularly

38
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.940
helpful for identifying and
visualizing slow queries.
