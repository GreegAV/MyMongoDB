Now at the other extreme, the opposite event can also cause sudden problems, an unexpected index build.

If you're building an index, your storage engine needs to create a lot of index entries.

This will be a blocking operation.

And depending on the size of the index, it could take time.

Your server won't take rights while the index is getting built.

We'll create an index.

Then we'll go to the log.

Here you can see the index build.

And if you look at the start and stop times, you can figure out how long it took.

Obviously, it didn't take long here, since I just spun up my replica set and everything was empty.

If you can catch an index build in action, you can also find it with db.currentOp.

But once an index build is in progress, you've already got a problem.

And by the time you connect, it's probably going to be done with.

But maybe you really need to build an index.

And maybe you can't afford to take the performance hit while an index is getting built.

What are your alternatives?

They basically all come down to planning.

We'll cover this in detail in our lesson on building indexes.
