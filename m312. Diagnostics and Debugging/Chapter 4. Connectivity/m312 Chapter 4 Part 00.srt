1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.280


2
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.060
So your application
is chugging along,

3
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.970
and then some
connectivity issues arise.

4
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.770
What do you see in
your application

5
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.460
that tells you that your problem
is an issue with connectivity?

6
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.500
So most likely what
you're going to see

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.730
are timeouts and
connection errors.

8
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.180
Some might be detected on
the client side, others

9
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.314
on the server side.

10
00:00:18.314 --> 00:00:19.730
And it's also
possible that you'll

11
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.190
see long hangs that
potentially don't

12
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.670
result in timeouts depending on
how your application is set up.

13
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.430
Your application should be
smart about these issues.

14
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.220
It should be able to turn
a long hang into an error

15
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.040
that it catches, and it
should log a message somewhere

16
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.050
describing the type of issue.

17
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.600
Finally, it should also
generate a notification

18
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.100
for you, the DBA.

19
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.720
But let's be realistic.

20
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.820
We live in an imperfect
world, developers

21
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.130
work under constraints, and
things aren't always set up

22
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.206
to be the way we'd
like them to be.

23
00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:49.580
So we may need to
do some digging

24
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.290
to find out the root cause.

25
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.920
What might it be?

26
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.920
Well, it could be any
of the following--

27
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.430
incorrect URIs, interference
from firewalls, or just

28
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.290
things out of your control.

29
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.450
Why might you have
an incorrect URI?

30
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.420
Well, maybe some of your
servers have valid URIs

31
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.270
for one another, which don't
resolve from the point of view

32
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.680
of the application.

33
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.290
The servers can all see each
other and everything works

34
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.080
until your primary goes
down, and your application

35
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.720
loses contact with the
entire replica set.

36
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.460
Alternatively,
maybe your servers

37
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.280
have non-static IP
addresses, so restarts

38
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.220
cause you to lose servers
unless you intervene.

39
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.710
Besides issues with
URIs, you might also

40
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.630
have a problem with a firewall.

41
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.340
Usually, the most
basic firewall issues

42
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.930
are caught early,
'cause they often

43
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.410
prevent your system from getting
set up until they're fixed.

44
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.480
But sometimes you
might have a situation

45
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.420
where your IP whitelist
only permits the application

46
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.420
to see some of the database
servers and not others.

47
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.840
Again, the issue arises when
the wrong server goes down.

48
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.700
Or maybe it's something
out of your control.

49
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.010
Maybe a DDoS is
hammering your servers,

50
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.400
or your ISP isn't doing
its job and packets just

51
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.750
aren't getting through.

52
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.420
We'll take a closer look at
these issues and similar ones

53
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.660
in this chapter.

54
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.560
Let's get started.
