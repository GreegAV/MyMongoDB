00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.310


2
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.080
Let's get a sense of
the tools we're going

3
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.150
to be using in this course.

4
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.190
When we look at
scenarios going forward,

5
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.590
this will be a basic
set of MongoDB tools

6
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.020
that we'll use to figure
out what's going on

7
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.360
and what we need to
do to fix things.

8
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.740
These tools are
the main ones you

9
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.840
should go to when
a problem arises,

10
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.080
and if you'll be diagnosing and
debugging problems in MongoDB,

11
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.390
you'll want to be
familiar with all of them.

12
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.700
First, let's look
at the server tools.

13
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.430
When I say server tools, these
are some helpware programs

14
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.770
that come with MongoDB.

15
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.270
The list includes the
following programs--

16
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.410
mongostat, which shows incoming
operations in real time;

17
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.320
mongotop, which
lets us know which

18
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.010
collections we're spending time
reading from and writing to;

19
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.280
mongoreplay, a very useful
tool, which is used to monitor,

20
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.380
record, and replay
network traffic

21
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.470
for diagnostic and
debugging purposes;

22
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.850
and last but not least, mongo,
our administrative shell,

23
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.700
which is the main command
line administration interface

24
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.589
of MongoDB.

25
00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.130
You've already been
using it to learn

26
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.780
some of the basics
of MongoDB, and we'll

27
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.196
be showing you some of the
functionality that can help you

28
00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:07.090
with diagnostics and debugging,
including information

29
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.340
about your indexes, the
state of the server,

30
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.370
and finding and managing
long-running operations.

31
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.530
We'll also be using the
database profiler, which

32
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.620
logs queries for us,
as well as MongoDB

33
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.650
Compass, our graphical
user interface, which

34
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.380
can be used to look at the
current state of your database,

35
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.020
and also has its own tools
to help you explore what's

36
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.020
happening on your server in
terms of real-time performance

37
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.310
metrics.

38
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.230
We'll also be using
a suite of programs

39
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.050
that fall under the name
of mtools, a public GitHub

40
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.800
repo created by our very
own Martin Rueckstiess.

41
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.080
These tools give you the
ability to spin-up replica

42
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.110
sets and sharded clusters
locally for testing purposes,

43
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.600
and also include a number
of log analysis tools

44
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.600
to help you find issues, and
workload generation tools that

45
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.550
can help with load testing.

46
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.872
Finally, while we won't be
able to spend time on them

47
00:01:53.872 --> 00:01:55.330
in this course,
you should at least

48
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.120
be aware of MongoDB
Cloud Manager and Ops

49
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.020
Manager, the MongoDB solutions
for cluster management.

50
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.450
If you're interested, you
can take our sister course--

51
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.800
M122.

52
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.704
You'll find a link
in the lecture notes.

53
00:02:07.704 --> 00:02:09.370
In this chapter, we're
going to give you

54
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.710
an overview of these
important tools.

55
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.750
Later on, we'll dive
deep into each of them

56
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.940
while we're exploring
simulated issues.

57
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.850
Let's get started.
