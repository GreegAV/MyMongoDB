In this lecture, at approximately 1:30, Will talks about field inclusion/exclusion for the serverStatus command. It isn't mentioned that some fields are included by default, and others are excluded by default.Specifying { locks : 1 } or { repl : 0 } explicitly includes or excludes these fields, overriding the default behavior.
