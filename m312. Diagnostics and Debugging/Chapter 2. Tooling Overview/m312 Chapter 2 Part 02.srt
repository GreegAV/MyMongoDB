00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.570


2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.920
In this lesson, we're going
to talk about the MongoDB

3
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.220
shell, also known as Mongo.

4
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.900
It comes with the
MongoDB software package.

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.540
For this course, we assume that
you're familiar with the shell,

6
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.610
most likely because
you've already been using

7
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.410
it to learn about MongoDB.

8
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.080
But in a nutshell,
the Mongo shell

9
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.900
is our default server command
line administration tool.

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.540
From the Mongo
shell, we can perform

11
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.455
any administrative command
that MongoDB provides.

12
00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:26.830
This includes
things that will be

13
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.692
useful from a diagnostics
and debugging perspective.

14
00:00:29.692 --> 00:00:31.900
Throughout the course, we'll
be using the Mongo shell

15
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.540
for many tasks, including
things like analyzing

16
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.900
queries, enabling profiling,
and changing server settings.

17
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.780
Another interesting
aspect of the shell

18
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.820
is the fact that we
can write JavaScript

19
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.270
that can be used to automate
administrative tasks.

20
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.580
We do have other tools
that provide or build

21
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.040
on this functionality
like Ops Manager,

22
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.220
but the Mongo shell remains
a powerful low-level tool

23
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.260
that can help in
finding and solving

24
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.454
many of the administrative
tasks that you face.

25
00:00:59.454 --> 00:00:59.953
