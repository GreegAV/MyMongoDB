1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.770
By the way, what about a query
that doesn't use the shard key.

3
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.310
Let's create another
index and query on it.

4
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.900
We'll create our index
on user.phonenumber.

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.450
We'll do a little query
that doesn't use an index

6
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.050
and which gives us a
phone number initially.

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.230
We'll run a query that
counts the number of users

8
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.460
with that phone number.

9
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.860
OK, we're going to
find a phone number.

10
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.800


11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.310
There we go.

12
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:41.780


13
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.180
OK, so we're going to create
an index on user.phonenumber.

14
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.830
We're going to find a
single phone number.

15
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.750
And we're going to count
the number of users

16
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.708
with that phone number.

17
00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:57.260


18
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.810
And it's just the one.

19
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.840
All right, let's
look at index stats.

20
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.590


21
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.830
Here, I'm querying just for
the phone numbers statistics.

22
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.620
And I can see that I
have accessed it twice--

23
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.906
one actually in
querying that first time

24
00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.280
to get our phone
number, and then

25
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.770
a second time for
that phone number.

26
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.730
You can see these queries
hit all of our shards.

27
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.720
So even though I only wanted
one document which is only

28
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.720
on one server, the query
hit every single one

29
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.230
of my servers, which it
has to because this query

30
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.830
doesn't use the shard key.

31
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.160
It's a scatter gather query.

32
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.830
We don't know which
shard has the document.

33
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.167
So for queries that
don't use the shard key,

34
00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:42.750
you can just count
the number of times

35
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.380
they appear on any server.

36
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.890
If it hits one,
it hits them all.

37
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.170
The moral is that if
you're using index stats,

38
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.620
you need to keep
track of servers,

39
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.610
even for a replica set
because you want to know

40
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.440
when your primary steps down.

41
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.900
For sharded cluster, it's
even more complicated,

42
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.170
and you really need to be aware
of what it is you're measuring.

43
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.820
You have to know,
for each query,

44
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.920
how many servers it hits.

45
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.860
This is simple for exact
match queries on a shard key

46
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.150
where it hits only one server.

47
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.240
And it's also simple for
scatter gather queries which

48
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.520
have to hit all the servers.

49
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.050
Range-based queries
on the shard key

50
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.730
though can hit one,
many, or all servers.

51
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.840
OK, what have we learned?

52
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.440
Well, we've learned
how to use index stats

53
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.110
and look at the
accesses.ops field

54
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.590
to see what queries are
hitting what indexes.

55
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.020
We've also learned how
to be careful of the host

56
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.270
field for replica sets.

57
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.510
And we've learned that
for charted clusters,

58
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.510
a query can be executed by
one, several, or all servers.

59
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.440
And that's how you
use index stats.
