00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.090


2
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.950
One of the cool new
features of Compass

3
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.550
is the ability to see real
time performance statistics

4
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.154
for the node I'm connected to.

5
00:00:07.154 --> 00:00:08.820
And so if I click on
the Performance tab

6
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.740
up at the top
here, what I'll see

7
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.890
is I actually get four
charts presented back

8
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.320
to me in the interface
that represent

9
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.980
key metrics that are occurring
on the MongoDB server

10
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.910
right now.

11
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.680
And so you can see
in the top chart here

12
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.040
we actually have an
Operations chart.

13
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.210
It's made up of inserts,
queries, updates,

14
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.600
deletes, commands,
and get mores.

15
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.360
And then we have a chart that
represents read and write

16
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.950
load on the server plus any
network load or memory usage

17
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.090
on the machine.

18
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.990
On the right-hand side here
what we see is two tables.

19
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.080
One represents the hottest
collections in the server

20
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.180
right now, and we'll
see for example

21
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.270
that actually a MongoDB
database and fan club

22
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.690
collection is at 0% usage.

23
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.285
This is a test box and
there's no traffic going on

24
00:00:57.285 --> 00:00:58.900
on this machine right now.

25
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.370
But if there were you would see
a percentage increase of read

26
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.489
and write traffic
displayed on this bar here.

27
00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.110
If there are any slow operations
going on on the server,

28
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.080
they'll be listed here, too.

29
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.990
And what we effectively
see is the output

30
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.700
from DB dot current up, which is
a core server internal command

31
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.870
that you can run to get an
understanding of any operations

32
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.600
that are occurring at
that time on the server.

33
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.600
And they'll be displayed
here in a table form,

34
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.480
and you'll be able to see
the type of operation,

35
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.360
whether it's a query or a
insert, and the operation ID,

36
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.420
and specifically what
the operation is.

37
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.640
You'll notice that the
data in these charts

38
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.080
moves fairly quickly.

39
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.860
These charts represent
roughly about 30-second window

40
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.570
of metric collection.

41
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.810
Now it may be that we
see a spike that we

42
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.790
want to drill into,
and we may want

43
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.470
to drill into it before we see
it disappearing off the window.

44
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.940
What we can do is actually
hit the Pause button

45
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.910
in the top right up
here to pause the charts

46
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.550
from adding any more data points
in before our spike ages out.

47
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.050
And when we're ready
we can actually

48
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.570
hover over and take
a look, and you'll

49
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.900
notice there's a trend line
down between all the charts

50
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.290
to indicate that this moment
in time was happening.

51
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.330
And we can take a
look, see if there's

52
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.210
anything interesting for
us to take a look at there.

53
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.440
When we're ready we can go
ahead and click Play again,

54
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.740
and the charts will simply catch
back up to the present time.
