In this lesson, we're going to talk about the MongoDB shell, also known as Mongo.

It comes with the MongoDB software package.

For this course, we assume that you're familiar with the shell, most likely because you've already been using it to learn about MongoDB.

But in a nutshell, the Mongo shell is our default server command line administration tool.

From the Mongo shell, we can perform any administrative command that MongoDB provides.

This includes things that will be useful from a diagnostics and debugging perspective.

Throughout the course, we'll be using the Mongo shell for many tasks, including things like analyzing queries, enabling profiling, and changing server settings.

Another interesting aspect of the shell is the fact that we can write JavaScript that can be used to automate administrative tasks.

We do have other tools that provide or build on this functionality like Ops Manager, but the Mongo shell remains a powerful low-level tool that can help in finding and solving many of the administrative tasks that you face.
