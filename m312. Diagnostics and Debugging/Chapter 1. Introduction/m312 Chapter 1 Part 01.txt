Let's talk a bit about how this course is going to work.

In a lot of courses, we would present the material in a way that's very ordered.

Each topic is touched upon once, and related topics are touched upon together.

In this course, we're going to try something different.

We'll introduce a lot of new tools early on, but we won't go very deep.

We'll give you a sense of how to use them, and then we'll move on.

In later chapters, we'll introduce scenarios where something is going wrong.

We'll describe what you're seeing, and when it's appropriate, we'll pull out a tool and show you how to use it to perform a diagnostic test.

That is when you'll really see what you want to do with that tool in that particular situation.

Maybe the tool will show you something useful, or maybe it will eliminate a hypothesis for what could have caused the issue.

During this course, we may touch on an individual tool several times and use it in several different ways.

The net result is that the course is going to be structured around issues and diagnostic questions rather than MongoDB features.

And that's how we'll structure things for the course.
