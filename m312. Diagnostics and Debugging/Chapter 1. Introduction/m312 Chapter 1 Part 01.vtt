00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.499


2
00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.570
Let's talk a bit about how
this course is going to work.

3
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.820
In a lot of courses, we
would present the material

4
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.980
in a way that's very ordered.

5
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.340
Each topic is touched upon
once, and related topics

6
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.380
are touched upon together.

7
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.350
In this course, we're going
to try something different.

8
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.100
We'll introduce a lot
of new tools early on,

9
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.160
but we won't go very deep.

10
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.910
We'll give you a sense
of how to use them,

11
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.260
and then we'll move on.

12
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.470
In later chapters, we'll
introduce scenarios

13
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.024
where something is going wrong.

14
00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:31.440
We'll describe
what you're seeing,

15
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.440
and when it's appropriate,
we'll pull out a tool

16
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.540
and show you how to use it
to perform a diagnostic test.

17
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.010
That is when you'll
really see what

18
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.920
you want to do with that tool
in that particular situation.

19
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.620
Maybe the tool will show
you something useful,

20
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.960
or maybe it will eliminate
a hypothesis for what

21
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.940
could have caused the issue.

22
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.730
During this course, we may
touch on an individual tool

23
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.030
several times and use it
in several different ways.

24
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.590
The net result is
that the course

25
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.190
is going to be structured around
issues and diagnostic questions

26
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.650
rather than MongoDB features.

27
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.550
And that's how we'll structure
things for the course.
