00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.400
Hi, my name is
Sam, and I'm going

3
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.520
to talk to you about an
exciting new tool for MongoDB

4
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.650
called MongoDB Compass.

5
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.990
Compass was developed
with one goal in mind--

6
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.380
to give you a powerful user
interface for understanding,

7
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.309
exploring, and editing
your MongoDB data,

8
00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.990
and providing you with insights
into your current server

9
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.460
and query performance.

10
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.910
Let's jump right
in and take a look.

11
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.490
MongoDB Compass was originally
designed and developed

12
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.230
with the intention of being
a full graphical shell

13
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.200
replacement for MongoDB.

14
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.549
Once you've downloaded and
opened MongoDB Compass,

15
00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:36.090
this is the first
window you're going

16
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.240
to see, the Connect screen.

17
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.510
There's a bunch of options
that we can fill out in order

18
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.420
to get connected to
a MongoDB instance,

19
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.230
and the first one is the host
name and the port of where

20
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.120
that instance is listening to.

21
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.780
So I'm actually going to use
one of my recent connections

22
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.070
and connect to this
IP on this port.

23
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.990
I also have the
ability to connect

24
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.040
to MongoDBs that are running
with authentication enabled,

25
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.510
such as a username and
password, Kerberos or LDAP,

26
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.870
or whether they're
enabled with SSL,

27
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.350
or simply I must use an SSH
tunnel to connect to them.

28
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.280
Right here I just have a test
instance running on a test

29
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.160
machine, and I don't have
any authentication, SSL,

30
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.190
or SSH tunneling
enabled, so I can just

31
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.650
go ahead and hit Connect.

32
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.010
Now once I've connected to my
MongoDB instance, what you'll

33
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.220
immediately see is
a list presented

34
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.720
to me of the database names
within the MongoDB instance

35
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.560
itself.

36
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.400
In this case you'll see I
have three-- admin, local,

37
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.754
and MongoDB.

38
00:01:45.754 --> 00:01:47.670
You'll see I have some
other information here,

39
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.250
such as the storage size
of the databases, a number

40
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.200
of collections within
those databases,

41
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.080
and the number of indexes
on those collections.

42
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.490
If I do want to
add a new database,

43
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.310
I can do so from this screen.

44
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.070
I simply just hit
Create Database.

45
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.500
And what I'll need to do
is fill in a new database

46
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.050
name and a new collection
name, and then I

47
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.130
have the option of making it
a capped collection or not.

48
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.920
And when I'm ready, I can go
ahead and Create Database.

49
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.250
And you'll see that gets
added to the list here.

50
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.860
If I do decide that I actually
want to delete that database,

51
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.890
I can do that through
the Compass interface

52
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.380
by clicking on
the trash can icon

53
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.290
and simply typing in
the name of the database

54
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.380
that I want to drop.
