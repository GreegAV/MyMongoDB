1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
In this course, we'll
focus on problems.

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.280
This means that after having
done a clear review of all

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.280
the tools and strategies to
follow so we can correctly

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.670
diagnose and debug an issue
with the MongoDB deployment,

5
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.000
we should get our heads together
and think how these tools will

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.630
be applied to diagnose common
issues with the deployment,

7
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.220
configuration, provisioning,
sizing, and application logic.

8
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.590
Hopefully, with
that in mind, you

9
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.830
can quickly relate to
your own applications

10
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.040
and be aware of how to
deal and diagnose correctly

11
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.130
with unintended situations.

12
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.260
There are a few
things that we can

13
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.140
perceive from the applications
and server hosts of MongoDB.

14
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.810
Let's say the symptoms that our
subjects may be demonstrating.

15
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.130
These generally will drive
us to blame the database.

16
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.910
That's OK.

17
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.390
Everyone does that.

18
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.080
But more importantly
than who to blame

19
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.810
is how to correctly
diagnose a situation

20
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.930
and perform corrective measures.

21
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.670
And there are a great
deal of symptoms

22
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.560
that we should be looking for.

23
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.349
We can have very slow queries.

24
00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.180
We will look into
the tools that will

25
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.040
help us identify such offenders
and how to correct those.

26
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.440
Applications getting slower
writing data as time goes by--

27
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.590
we will look into
patterns and check

28
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.980
the tool that will allow
us to identify and monitor

29
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.510
a potential solution.

30
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.230
Aggregation pipelines aborting
for lack of resources--

31
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.450
something to keep in mind.

32
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.550
Server incurring
a high disk IO--

33
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.280
how to detect it, how to get
to the bottom of the problem.

34
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.090
Incorrect file system
configuration--

35
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.130
these can be very hard to find
in development environments,

36
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.740
but we will soon get into
trouble if we don't attend them

37
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.780
in production.

38
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.720
Incorrect MongoDB
configuration-- these can span

39
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.420
from unintended behavior
from incorrect configurations

40
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.150
of cache sizes, timeouts,
flushing intervals,

41
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.730
and write concerns.

42
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.600
Application driver integration--
how the application makes

43
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.480
use of our driver, which
commands it senses,

44
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.160
and how these can derive
in unintended situations.

45
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.430
Connectivity issues--
when we inadvertently

46
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.680
incorrectly configure
our system, that

47
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.100
will impact the connectivity
of our deployment.

48
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.730
And then cluster configuration--
by incorrectly provisioning

49
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.070
or using replica sets
and shared clusters

50
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.200
we might get ourselves
into situations

51
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.560
that are important to
understand and fix.

52
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.080
These are some of
the aspects that we

53
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.930
are going to approach
within different chapters

54
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.730
of this course and introduce the
tools and strategies to detect,

55
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.540
diagnose, monitor, and fix
these unwanted scenarios.
