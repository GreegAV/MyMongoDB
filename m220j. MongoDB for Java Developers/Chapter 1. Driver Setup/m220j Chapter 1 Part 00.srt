Hello and welcome to
Chapter One of the course.

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.060
We've already covered all of
the bookkeeping information

4
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.830
for the course and explored
the application structure.

5
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.425
So now it's time to dive in.

6
00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:14.310
In this chapter we're going to
discuss and explore basic read

7
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.580
operations, adding
fuel protections,

8
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.570
and how to handle
different query predicates

9
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.840
to allow searching our
data set from the UI.

10
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.880
Our goal is that by
the end of this chapter

11
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.500
you are comfortable
with basic query

12
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.440
semantics and basic shaping
operations the decline

13
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.170
application might
typically require.

14
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.510
Remember to read those
user stories closely

15
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.860
and run the unit tests.

16
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.410
And I hope you enjoy
this chapter of M220.
