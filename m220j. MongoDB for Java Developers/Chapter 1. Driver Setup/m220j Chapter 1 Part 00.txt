Hello and welcome to Chapter One of the course.

We've already covered all of the bookkeeping information for the course and explored the application structure.

So now it's time to dive in.

In this chapter we're going to discuss and explore basic read operations, adding fuel protections, and how to handle different query predicates to allow searching our data set from the UI.

Our goal is that by the end of this chapter you are comfortable with basic query semantics and basic shaping operations the decline application might typically require.

Remember to read those user stories closely and run the unit tests.

And I hope you enjoy this chapter of M220.
