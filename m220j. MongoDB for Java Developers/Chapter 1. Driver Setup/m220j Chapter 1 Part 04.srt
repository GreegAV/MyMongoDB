1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.210


2
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.860
In this lesson, we
are going to connect

3
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.400
your newly created Atlas
cluster to MongoDB Compass

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.400
and explore some of the
functionality of Compass.

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.410
If you don't have
Compass on your machine,

6
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.380
please download it by
following the link below.

7
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.590
First, let's connect
to our Atlas cluster.

8
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.390
After following the
read me, your cluster

9
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.080
should look something like this.

10
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.460
In Atlas, hit Connect
under the cluster name.

11
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.090
And then connect
with MongoDB Compass.

12
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.680
If you have Compass open
when you're doing this,

13
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.330
you'll notice a message
pop-up saying that a MongoDB

14
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.450
connection string is detected.

15
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.870
If you click on Yes,
most of the information

16
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.930
required for the connection
will be filled in for you.

17
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.210
The only thing that you
will have to specify

18
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.540
is the password.

19
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.960
Otherwise, make sure that
the filled in information

20
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.860
corresponds to what is provided
for you below the video.

21
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.690
And hit Connect.

22
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.850
Once connected, you
should be able to see

23
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.130
the databases available to you.

24
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.340
Admin and local are
default databases

25
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.050
and are already in place
when you create a cluster.

26
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.920
Let's take a look at mflix,
which we recently imported.

27
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.800
You can select the database
that you're interested in

28
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.950
either from the left
menu, where you can also

29
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.260
get the list of the
collections in the database,

30
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.020
or by clicking on the
database in the right section

31
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.640
of the screen.

32
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.970
Today, we will explore
the movies collection.

33
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.950
This is the Documents
tab that gives you

34
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.950
a preview of the documents
in the collection.

35
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.370
Here, you can see that there is
a document with a film titled

36
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.400
Carmencita with a
cast of one person,

37
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.100
Carmencita, a poster located
at the given URL, and so on.

38
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.100
Not all documents have all
the same fields as this one.

39
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.100
And various fields contain
various data types in them.

40
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.670
You can explore this tab
later on your own time.

41
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.250
To get a better overview of
the various data types that

42
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.230
are involved in the
movies collection,

43
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.050
we will check out the
Schema tab in Compass.

44
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.710
But, first, let's clarify
what schema means.

45
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.020
Schema is structure.

46
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.790
And in case of MongoDB,
it is document structure.

47
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.770
MongoDB is a flexible
schema database,

48
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.930
which simply means that
the structure isn't

49
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.330
enforced unless you tell it so.

50
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.920
For example, you can see that
in this document some fields are

51
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.130
present in all documents
and some aren't.

52
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.180
Let's move on to the Schema tab.

53
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.940
Hit Analyze Schema.

54
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.820
Analyze Schema gives us
a summary of the document

55
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.000
structure based on a
sample of 1,000 documents

56
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.380
in the collection.

57
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.320
This allows us to
explore another aspect

58
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.660
of a schema flexible
database, which

59
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.420
is that you can create
collections with fields that

60
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.390
have varying value types
across different documents

61
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.250
without getting an error.

62
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.180
The left column represents the
field names and data types.

63
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.030
The right column gives
us a general summary

64
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.850
about the values
these fields hold.

65
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.970
For example, if we look
at the awards field,

66
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.500
we can see that
some of the values

67
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.132
are strings, while
some are undefined.

68
00:03:05.132 --> 00:03:06.840
And if you look at
the graph on the right

69
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.140
and you hover over some
of the values there,

70
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.900
you see that 10% of the
films have one nomination, 6%

71
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.590
have two wins, and so on.

72
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.570
The cast field is
a bit different

73
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.370
and seems to be
mostly array values

74
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.500
with a small fraction
of the values having

75
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.530
an undefined type.

76
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.090
An array does not
give us quite enough

77
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.830
information about
the field, which

78
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.550
is why underneath that label
you can see string label, which

79
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.650
tells us that the
values in these arrays

80
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.240
are of type string.

81
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.080
Clicking from one to another
gives us a different kind

82
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.000
of summary on the right.

83
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.200
With array, we get the
summary about arrays.

84
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.290
With string, we get the
sample of string values.

85
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.840
Other interesting data types
that we can observe here

86
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.780
are date, integer, and
document, which you

87
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.180
can explore in a similar way.

88
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.860
You can use the
Schema tab to get

89
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.170
an idea of the
documents and data types

90
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.450
that you will be dealing with.

91
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.750
Another useful Compass feature
is located in the Aggregations

92
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.500
tab.

93
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.660
If you don't have the
latest version of Compass,

94
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.790
but you want to have
access to this feature,

95
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.860
feel free to pause
this video and update

96
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.170
your version of Compass
to any version above 1.14.

97
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.510
Throughout this course,
you will be exposed to

98
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.960
and will work with different
types of MongoDB queries.

99
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.120
The Aggregations
tab in Compass helps

100
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.940
to organize, construct,
save, and more

101
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.220
when working with
aggregation queries.

102
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.320
You will cover the
details of how exactly

103
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.070
an aggregation query works
later in this course.

104
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.640
For the purposes
of this lecture,

105
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.580
I'm going to create a
simple query looking

106
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.570
for all documents whose
director field value matches

107
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.660
Sam Raimi, the great director
of the Army of Darkness

108
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.700
and other masterpieces.

109
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.970
What if I wanted to use this
query in my code somewhere?

110
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.320
We can do that, too.

111
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.620
Hit the Menu icon on the
right of SAVE PIPELINE,

112
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.780
and select Export To Language.

113
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.360
Feel free to look at the
other options in that drop

114
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.690
down menu in your spare time.

115
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.160
They are all addressed in
our documentation in the link

116
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.120
below.

117
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.130
To use this query
in your application,

118
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.900
you selected Export To Language.

119
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.950
And, now, you can select the
language of your choice, which

120
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.800
in our case is Java.

121
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.740
Success.

122
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.410
You can now copy a
line of Java code

123
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.790
into your Java-based
application.

124
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.120
And if you haven't yet
import to the libraries

125
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.460
necessary for MongoDB
and Java to communicate,

126
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.510
you can select Include
Import Statements

127
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.720
to see which tools are needed
for this particular query

128
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.520
to run successfully.

129
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.520
You can then copy, paste this
in the appropriate section

130
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.150
of your application and get
along with your development.

131
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.730
You can check out the
documentation for this feature

132
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.830
by following the linked below.

133
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.990
Feel free to experiment
with these features

134
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.310
and try them out on your
own before moving on

135
00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.830
to the next lecture.

136
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.350
This is the end of our
Compass Basics lesson.

137
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.500
Enjoy what follows.
