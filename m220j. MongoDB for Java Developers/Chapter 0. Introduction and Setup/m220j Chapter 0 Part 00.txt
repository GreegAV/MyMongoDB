Hi MongoDB Java developer, welcome to M220J.

I'm Varsha and it's my pleasure to be one of your instructors.

This course is one of our language variant courses for MongoDB developers.

It's intended for people who have taken our introduction to MongoDB course or have two to three months of experience working with MongoDB.

You should have basic familiarity with Java before starting this course.

Here, you will learn how to use MongoDB's Java driver to build performant, resilient, and robust applications.

You'll be put in the role of a new developer on a team implementing the database layer of an API.

Each lab in this course is called a ticket and each ticket has a user story and unit tests.

For a given ticket, you will read the user story, make all the tests pass, and use the pre-packaged UI to run integration tests and get your validation code for the corresponding ticket.

Throughout this course, you will learn to create and share a database connection, perform the basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations through the driver, handle errors, utilize the MongoDB best practices and more.

The technology stack is pretty simple.

We're using Spring Boot, MongoDB, and React.

The React application is pre-built and bundled for you and the API layer is also fully implemented.

You'll only be implementing the functions which directly call to MongoDB.

So welcome again to this course.

We hope you enjoy the material that we've prepared for you and wish you the best of luck.
