Hi MongoDB Java developer,
welcome to M220J.

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.330
I'm Varsha and it's my pleasure
to be one of your instructors.

4
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.130
This course is one of
our language variant

5
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.117
courses for MongoDB developers.

6
00:00:11.117 --> 00:00:13.450
It's intended for people who
have taken our introduction

7
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.660
to MongoDB course or have two
to three months of experience

8
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.286
working with MongoDB.

9
00:00:18.286 --> 00:00:19.660
You should have
basic familiarity

10
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.460
with Java before
starting this course.

11
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.220
Here, you will learn how to
use MongoDB's Java driver

12
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.350
to build performant, resilient,
and robust applications.

13
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.270
You'll be put in the
role of a new developer

14
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.810
on a team implementing the
database layer of an API.

15
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.690
Each lab in this course
is called a ticket

16
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.310
and each ticket has a
user story and unit tests.

17
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.470
For a given ticket, you
will read the user story,

18
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.990
make all the tests pass,
and use the pre-packaged UI

19
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.270
to run integration tests
and get your validation code

20
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.377
for the corresponding ticket.

21
00:00:48.377 --> 00:00:49.960
Throughout this
course, you will learn

22
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.420
to create and share a
database connection,

23
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.810
perform the basic Create, Read,
Update, and Delete operations

24
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.930
through the driver, handle
errors, utilize the MongoDB

25
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.190
best practices and more.

26
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.430
The technology stack
is pretty simple.

27
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.500
We're using Spring Boot,
MongoDB, and React.

28
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.240
The React application is
pre-built and bundled for you

29
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.582
and the API layer is
also fully implemented.

30
00:01:11.582 --> 00:01:13.290
You'll only be
implementing the functions

31
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.510
which directly call to MongoDB.

32
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.204
So welcome again to this course.

33
00:01:17.204 --> 00:01:19.620
We hope you enjoy the material
that we've prepared for you

34
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.010
and wish you the best of luck.
