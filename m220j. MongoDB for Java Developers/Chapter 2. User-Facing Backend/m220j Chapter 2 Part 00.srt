00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.724
Hello and welcome to Chapter 2
of the M220 Developer Course.

3
00:00:03.724 --> 00:00:05.640
I hope you've had success
developing the mflix

4
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.824
application into a
MongoDB database client.

5
00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:09.240
Setting up the
driver to read data

6
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.370
from Mongo into your
application is fundamental.

7
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.578
And I hope you've enjoyed
building that crucial piece

8
00:00:13.578 --> 00:00:14.670
of infrastructure.

9
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.920
Now that we do have a
connection from mflix to Mongo,

10
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.628
we can start really
leveraging the driver

11
00:00:18.628 --> 00:00:20.805
to create a more functional
and durable backend.

12
00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:23.580
In this chapter, we'll learn
why some complex queries are not

13
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.620
possible with the
query language alone

14
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.780
and how the aggregation
framework can actually

15
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.760
help us build these queries.

16
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.189
We'll start using the driver
to write data to MongoDB.

17
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.026
But not all those writes
are created equal.

18
00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:35.400
We'll explore the
nature of these

19
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.900
writes to determine which are
critical to our application

20
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.358
and then use the
driver to increase

21
00:00:39.358 --> 00:00:41.200
the durability of those writes.

22
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.040
As far as mflix is concerned,
the application's functionality

23
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.050
will grow immensely
in this chapter.

24
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.910
New users will be
able to join the site,

25
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.770
update their preferences,
and leave reviews

26
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.590
on the movies they
feel strongly about.

27
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.230
We'll even allow users to edit
or remove their own reviews,

28
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.550
but make sure they can't
mess with anyone else's.

29
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.500
All told, this is
a dynamite chapter

30
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.657
designed to make you comfortable
writing mflix data to Mongo.

31
00:01:01.657 --> 00:01:03.240
At the end of the
chapter, mflix users

32
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.950
should be able to not only read
about their favorite movies,

33
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.720
but actually create a
community on the site.
