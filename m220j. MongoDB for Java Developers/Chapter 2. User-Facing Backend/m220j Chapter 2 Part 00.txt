Hello and welcome to Chapter 2 of the M220 Developer Course.

I hope you've had success developing the mflix application into a MongoDB database client.

Setting up the driver to read data from Mongo into your application is fundamental.

And I hope you've enjoyed building that crucial piece of infrastructure.

Now that we do have a connection from mflix to Mongo, we can start really leveraging the driver to create a more functional and durable backend.

In this chapter, we'll learn why some complex queries are not possible with the query language alone and how the aggregation framework can actually help us build these queries.

We'll start using the driver to write data to MongoDB.

But not all those writes are created equal.

We'll explore the nature of these writes to determine which are critical to our application and then use the driver to increase the durability of those writes.

As far as mflix is concerned, the application's functionality will grow immensely in this chapter.

New users will be able to join the site, update their preferences, and leave reviews on the movies they feel strongly about.

We'll even allow users to edit or remove their own reviews, but make sure they can't mess with anyone else's.

All told, this is a dynamite chapter designed to make you comfortable writing mflix data to Mongo.

At the end of the chapter, mflix users should be able to not only read about their favorite movies, but actually create a community on the site.
