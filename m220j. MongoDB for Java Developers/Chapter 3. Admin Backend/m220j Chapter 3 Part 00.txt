Hello and welcome to Chapter 3 of the M220 Developer Course.

I hope you were successfully able to build the user-facing back end of the MFlix application.

Now we can move on to the admin back end.

In this chapter, we'll learn how to use different read concerns, join collections using expressive $lookup, perform bulk operations, and clean data.

With that you'll be able to expand the functionality of your MFlix site.

This will include reporting on a movie's popularity and listing all reviews.

This is going to be a great chapter, so good luck and have fun.
