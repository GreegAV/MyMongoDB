00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.821
Hello and welcome to Chapter 3
of the M220 Developer Course.

3
00:00:03.821 --> 00:00:05.570
I hope you were
successfully able to build

4
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.480
the user-facing back end
of the MFlix application.

5
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.704
Now we can move on to
the admin back end.

6
00:00:10.704 --> 00:00:13.370
In this chapter, we'll learn how
to use different read concerns,

7
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.320
join collections using
expressive $lookup,

8
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.654
perform bulk operations,
and clean data.

9
00:00:17.654 --> 00:00:19.820
With that you'll be able
to expand the functionality

10
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.085
of your MFlix site.

11
00:00:21.085 --> 00:00:23.210
This will include reporting
on a movie's popularity

12
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.680
and listing all reviews.

13
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.780
This is going to be a
great chapter, so good luck

14
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.690
and have fun.
