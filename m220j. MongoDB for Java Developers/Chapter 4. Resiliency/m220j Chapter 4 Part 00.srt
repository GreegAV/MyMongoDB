00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.499


2
00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.740
Welcome to Chapter 4.

3
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.570
We are almost there.

4
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.490
Before we start
uncorking the champagne

5
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.650
and celebrating your course
completion certificate,

6
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.380
we need to go through the
last chapter of this course.

7
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.720
This chapter is all about
application resilience

8
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.890
and robustness.

9
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.360
We will be looking
to how to make

10
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.990
your applications resilient to a
variety of different situations

11
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.450
that may impact the
performance and availability

12
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.620
of your system.

13
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.409
Don't forget, we are living in
a distributive database world,

14
00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:27.450
and therefore, we need to
prepare our application

15
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.420
to be robust and performant,
as well as scalable.

16
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.080
Hang tight.

17
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.140
This is going to be fun.
