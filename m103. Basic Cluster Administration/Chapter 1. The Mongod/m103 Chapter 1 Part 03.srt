1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,440
In this lesson, we'll cover
a few of the basic commands

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,440
necessary to interact
with the MongoDB cluster.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,230
This won't be an
exhaustive list.

5
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,430
For that, take a look at
the reference documentation

6
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,650
included in the lecture notes.

7
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,710
We're actually going to focus
on the shell helpers first.

8
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,140
These are methods available
in the MongoDB shell

9
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,750
that wrap underlying
database commands.

10
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,090
The majority of your
interactions in this course

11
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,390
and likely in general
will use shell helpers.

12
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,450
First you have your
DB shell helpers.

13
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,850
These are methods that
wrap commands that interact

14
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,990
with the database.

15
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,360
You've already used a few of
these in previous lessons,

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,490
like db.createuser.

17
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,170
Next you have your
rs helper methods.

18
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,320
These methods wrap commands
that control replica

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,340
set deployment and management.

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,240
We're going to talk about
replication in week two.

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,070
Finally, you have your
sh helper methods.

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,610
These methods wrap commands
to control sharded cluster

23
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,350
deployment and management.

24
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,080
We will get to
sharding in week three.

25
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,590
Now the database shell helper
has one additional extension.

26
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,090
Remember that each
database can have

27
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,620
one or more collections in it.

28
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,090
And collections are where
your data is stored.

29
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,080
So Mongo shell provides shell
helpers for collection level

30
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,077
operations.

31
00:01:10,077 --> 00:01:11,660
You specify the name
of the collection

32
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,270
here, essentially providing
a path to the collection

33
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,207
you want to interact with.

34
00:01:16,207 --> 00:01:18,290
Let's go over some of the
most basic shell helpers

35
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,750
that you may find useful
during this course.

36
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,440
For user management, you've
got create user and drop user.

37
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,920
You've already used create
user in an earlier lesson.

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,040
Note that both of these are
acting on the database object.

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,430
That's because users are
created at the database level.

40
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,610
For collection management,
you can use rename collection

41
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,610
to change the name of
an existing collection.

42
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,640
You also have
collection.createindex

43
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,770
and collection.drop.

44
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,860
Both of these methods act on
the collection object, which

45
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,819
is why we have db.collection.

46
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,860
In the shell, you'd want
to change the collection

47
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,630
to the name of the collection.

48
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,640
This is just a placeholder.

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,150
For database management, you
can always use drop database

50
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,680
to drop the entire database.

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,250
This will destroy all
collections, indexes,

52
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,150
and users created
on that database,

53
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,360
so use this with caution.

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,970
db.createcollection lets
you create a collection

55
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,170
on your own.

56
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,290
In a previous lesson, we noted
that MongoDB creates databases

57
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,410
and collections implicitly
on a write operation,

58
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,997
but you may want to create
your collections first.

59
00:02:23,997 --> 00:02:26,330
There are some additional
configuration options you have

60
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,270
when you use this method, such
as creating a capped collection

61
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,820
or setting language collation
support, both of which

62
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,660
are out of scope
for this lesson.

63
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,590
So look at the documentation
if you're curious.

64
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,120
Finally, when you want to see
how your database is doing,

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,180
you've got
db.serverstatus, which

66
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,740
returns statistics
on the database,

67
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,010
like the amount of storage
space you are using.

68
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,760
We're going to talk
more about replication

69
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,240
and sharding in later lessons.

70
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,220
And you'll see examples of the
rs and sh shell helpers then

71
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,200
I mentioned earlier
that shell helpers wrap

72
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,180
an underlying database command.

73
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,090
Let's look at the
db.collection.createindex

74
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,730
method, compared against the
underlying create indexes

75
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,860
command.

76
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,120
While they look sort of
similar, the database command

77
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,860
is a lot more
verbose in defining

78
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,870
the same level of work.

79
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,240
That's part of why MongoDB
provides helper methods

80
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,640
for wrapping these
database commands.

81
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,040
Depending on whether you're
using the MongoDB shell

82
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,250
or MongoDB driver, the exact
name and format of these helper

83
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,320
methods might differ,
but their purpose

84
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,710
is to provide a shortcut
for methods like this.

85
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,480
Running a database
command itself

86
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,260
is pretty straightforward.

87
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,770
The Mongo shell provides
the run command method

88
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,590
on the database object.

89
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,930
You pass in the command as
a parameter to this method.

90
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,720
DB here refers to
the active database.

91
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,970
Do you remember the use keyword?

92
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,040
We've used it a
few times already.

93
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,679
The run command always works
against the active database.

94
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,720
So make sure you set the
right database to active

95
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,054
before you use run command.

96
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:52,470
If you want information on how
a particular command works,

97
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,350
you can use the
db.commandhelp method

98
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,470
to retrieve any available
help information.

99
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,150
Now you might
wonder, why would I

100
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,720
ever want to use the
underlying database command?

101
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,140
Well, we've been talking
about the shell helpers.

102
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,260
They're only in the shell.

103
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,890
If you want to run a database
command from a driver,

104
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,620
then you're going to need to
execute the underlying database

105
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,960
command instead, assuming
that the driver doesn't

106
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,870
have some other
existing helper method.

107
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,450
You can actually introspect
a shell helper from the shell

108
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,900
by not including the open
and closing parentheses.

109
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,110
The shell helper will produce
the underlying code run.

110
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,690
In this case, we can see
that create index method

111
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,750
runs the create indexes command.

112
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,690
To recap, the database
commands provide the foundation

113
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,850
for interacting with MongoDB.

114
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,170
You can use db.run command to
run any given database command.

115
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,120
The Mongo shell
provides helper methods

116
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,219
for wrapping database commands
and simplifying usage.

117
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:49,760
For this course, you're going
to be using the helper methods,

118
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,176
but if you want to know more
about the underlying database

119
00:04:52,176 --> 00:00:00,000
commands, check out
our documentation.
