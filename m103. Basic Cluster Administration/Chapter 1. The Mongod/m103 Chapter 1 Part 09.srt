1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,499


2
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:01,970
Now the first thing
I'm going to do

3
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,400
is basically connect
with an existing user

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,020
that we've previously created--

5
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,259
our root level user.

6
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,800
Once I'm connected
and authenticated,

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,190
the first thing I'm going to do
is create my security officer,

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,490
which enables user admin role.

9
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,540
In this case, I'm creating
it on the admin database.

10
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:25,470
Now, this is the first user
you should always create.

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,380
And why is that?

12
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,470
Well the main reason for this
is that this particular role

13
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,050
allows the user to do all
operations around user

14
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,160
management.

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,860
But in themself is not
able to do anything

16
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,010
related with data management
or data modifications.

17
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,160
Cannot create or write,
cannot list databases,

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,040
cannot do anything around
database administration aside

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,702
from creating and updating
or reviewing database users.

20
00:00:50,702 --> 00:00:52,160
This is quite
important if you want

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,560
to ensure that there
are specific users

22
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,650
in your organization that are
not allowed to do anything

23
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,480
with data in your system--

24
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,220
just managing other users that
themselves can create the data.

25
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,830
So the command for doing that
is the create user, as always.

26
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,130
We'll create a user we are
calling here security officer,

27
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,390
passing a password, the roles
where it's going to be created.

28
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,340
And the command gets
successfully created.

29
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,900
Now next, I'm going
to create a user that

30
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,440
is allowed to actually
administer the database.

31
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,700
Yep, you got it.

32
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,080
It's our dbAdmin role--

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,420
a user that is created
using this role.

34
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,970
Now the list of privileges that
this particular role enables

35
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,180
is quite long.

36
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,650
But it can get a feeling
of what it can actually do.

37
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,980
All the statistical data,
kill cursors, lists indexes,

38
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,470
list databases and
collections, get

39
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,960
collect statistics
on the collections,

40
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,720
do collection modifications,
convert to capped.

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,570
There's a variety of
different operations

42
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,770
that this built in role
allows the user to operate.

43
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,650
But again, similar to
the user admin role,

44
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,590
this role does not
have the ability

45
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:12,500
to read any user data at all
or write data for that fact.

46
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,440
Everything that is related
with DDL, data definition

47
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,130
language, this user
will be able to perform.

48
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,610
Everything that is related
with the DML, data modification

49
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,730
language operations, he
will not be able to do.

50
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,640
This is to prevent the dba
to go in and modify data

51
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,074
inadvertently.

52
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:31,865
Does not stop him from
dropping collections

53
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:34,480
though because that's
a DDL operation.

54
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,210
But it cannot remove specific
fields from a document or even

55
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,505
create new documents
in a collection.

56
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:42,630
Let's go ahead and do that.

57
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,690
So here I have my dba user
with some password and the role

58
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:53,390
that I've given him on the
database m103 is role dbAdmin.

59
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,760
Now if you look closely
to this operation,

60
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,680
I'm doing something
quite tricky.

61
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,440
I'm using the database admin
to create a user on admin,

62
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,220
but granting a role of
dbAdmin on M103 database.

63
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,510
Although this might sound
a little bit strange,

64
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,180
this is actually a
recommended approach.

65
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,060
All users should be
created on the database

66
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,060
admin for simplicity reasons.

67
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,980
That means that
the database admin

68
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,160
will be used to authenticate
the users that we create.

69
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,990
That said, it might
not be needing

70
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,290
to access the database
admin at all for doing

71
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,040
what it's supposed to do.

72
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,420
So if he wants to be
administrator on M103,

73
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,430
the roles of dbAdmin should
only be granted to M103.

74
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,370
Roles can also vary
between databases.

75
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,790
I can have a given user with
different roles on a per

76
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,990
database basis.

77
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,300
So let's go ahead and do that.

78
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,070
Let's do that to
this database user.

79
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,060
Now to do that, I can just
simply use this grant roles

80
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,770
to user, when I select the user,
which is my dba that I recently

81
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,450
created.

82
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,720
I'm going to give it a
database playground where

83
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,190
this particular user
will be the dbOwner.

84
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:18,140
Once I do this, the role
dbOwner is the database owner.

85
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,870
And therefore, it can do
any administrative action

86
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,100
on the database.

87
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,350
That also means that
this role combines

88
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:29,630
all privileges of read write,
dbAdmin, and user admin roles.

89
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:34,550
That said, any user which is
granted dbOwner over a database

90
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,310
can actually do pretty
much anything he wants.

91
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,680
You can read write,
it can dbAdmin,

92
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,400
and it can even user admin
on that same database.

93
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,370
So you can interpret this
dbOwner role as a meta role--

94
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,790
one that combines several
other built in roles

95
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,830
that MongoDB provides.

96
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,320
And we can see that by
running this command--

97
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,750
rolesInfo where you want
to know what dbOwner

98
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,240
is on the db playground.

99
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,660
We can also say to
show the privileges

100
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,160
of this particular role.

101
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,010
Once we do that, we can have the
list of all different actions

102
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,280
and resources, meaning
the privileges,

103
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,810
of each role that this
particular role inherits

104
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,880
for himself.

105
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,390
Let's recap.

106
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,770
We've looked into the
structure of the roles

107
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,640
and how they are defined.

108
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,810
We've seen the list of
built in roles and how they

109
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,150
are logically grouped together.

110
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,840
And finally, we've seen how
to create and grant roles

111
00:05:39,840 --> 00:00:00,000
to users using the
built in roles.
