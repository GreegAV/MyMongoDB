00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730


2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,400
Time for us to talk a
little bit about roles,

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,040
in particular, about
built-in roles in MongoDB,

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,200
and how the role-based
access control system works.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,340
Now, there is a fair
amount to say about roles.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,790
But by now, you should be aware
that MongoDB role-based access

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:24,250
control system is in place,
and that database users will

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,420
be granted roles to perform
operations of MongoDB.

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,210
So we're not going to
cover that in this lesson.

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,970
Roles can be of two types.

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,710
It can be either custom roles,
which are tailored roles

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,310
to attend specific needs of
specific users, which we are

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,670
also not going to
cover in this lecture,

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,990
and built-in roles, which are
prepackaged MongoDB roles.

15
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,440
Now, saying that we are not
going to cover custom roles,

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,530
doesn't mean you cannot
learn about them.

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,640
And we have a specific
course, MongoDB Security,

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,770
for you to learn everything
related with security,

19
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,960
including the custom roles.

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,020
So I do recommend
you to take that,

21
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,660
if you want to learn a
lot more about custom

22
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,500
roles in other security
aspects of MongoDB.

23
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,290
But before we go into the
list of built-in roles,

24
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,280
the MongoDB packages, let's
talk about the role structure,

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,290
how can we define roles, or how
roles are defined internally.

26
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,180
A role is composed
by the following.

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,760
There is a set of privileges
that the role enables.

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,250
If a new user is
granted a given role,

29
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,740
all privileges that
that role defines

30
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,570
will be made
available to the user.

31
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:36,250
And a privilege defines
the action, or actions,

32
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,114
that can be performed
over a resource.

33
00:01:40,114 --> 00:01:42,850
A resource on its
own can be defined

34
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,600
by either being a set
of specific database

35
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,700
and specific collection, any
database in any collection,

36
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,090
any database in a
set of collections,

37
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,030
or a specific database
in all collections

38
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,020
within that database.

39
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,880
And finally, we also have
the cluster level resource

40
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,490
that applies to operations
regarding the replica

41
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,720
sets or shard clusters.

42
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,140
A privilege is
defined by a resource

43
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,950
and the actions allowed
over that same resource.

44
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,140
So for example,
here, we would have

45
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,900
the system allowing the
shut down of a full cluster.

46
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,880
By that, we define the
resource cluster equals true,

47
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,870
and the action to be shutdown.

48
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,520
A role with such
a privilege will

49
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,910
be allowed to shut down
any member of the cluster.

50
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,380
But apart of having
a list of privileges,

51
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,950
a role can also inherit
from other roles, either one

52
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,910
or several of them, making
this a potentially quite

53
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,110
elaborate architecture
of permission

54
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,000
and privileges across
several different roles.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,600
And finally, we can also
define network authentication

56
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,330
restrictions at the role level.

57
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,110
This basically allows us to
define that a given role is

58
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,200
allowed to connect
from a clientSource,

59
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,120
or to a serverAddress, by
specifying the set of list

60
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,010
of clientSource
and serverAddress

61
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,451
in the network restrictions.

62
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:14,950
OK.

63
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,790
So now that we've seen how
the roles are organized,

64
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,950
or defined, let's look into this
set of different built-in roles

65
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,450
that MongoDB provides.

66
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,210
So the built-in
roles are organized

67
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,160
by four different sets of
groups, plus this super user

68
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,840
role type.

69
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,840
We have database
level users, which can

70
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,880
either be read and readWrite.

71
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,210
These are the
application users that

72
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,520
should be allowed to
read or read and write.

73
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,470
We have database administration
roles, like userAdmin, dbAdmin,

74
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,680
and dbOwner.

75
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,710
We have cluster level
administration roles,

76
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,560
which are clusterAdmin,
clusterManager, clusterMonitor,

77
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,210
and hostManager.

78
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,020
We have specific roles
for backup and restore.

79
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,350
And obviously, we also
have our super user root

80
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:13,090
role that should be granted
only in specific situations.

81
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,410
All the roles defined here
are purely database level

82
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,820
for each user.

83
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,450
That means that I can
grant different roles,

84
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,940
to different users, on
different databases.

85
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,030
But there are also
built-in roles

86
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,880
that are all database level.

87
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,900
That means they apply to
any database in the system.

88
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,140
For the database users, we
have readAnyDatabase or read

89
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,820
and write any database.

90
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,580
For database administration,
we have dbAdminAnyDatabase,

91
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,750
or userAdminAnyDatabase.

92
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,950
And obviously, this
super user nature of root

93
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:53,110
is, in fact, a whole
database level role, as well.

94
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,830
But these are a lot of them.

95
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,820
So I want to focus your
attention on the ones

96
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,770
that we're going to need
throughout this course--

97
00:05:00,770 --> 00:00:00,000
userAdmin, dbOwner, and dbAdmin.
