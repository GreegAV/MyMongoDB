00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730


2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,732
Hi there, and welcome to M103,
basic cluster administration.

3
00:00:04,732 --> 00:00:06,190
My name's Matt,
and I'm going to be

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,440
one of your instructors
for this course.

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,450
Together, we'll learn
about deploying MongoDB

6
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,860
in various
architectures, and how

7
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,512
to use the basic administrative
tools at your disposal.

8
00:00:14,512 --> 00:00:15,970
In the first chapter,
we'll discuss

9
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,710
Mongod, which is
the core database

10
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,780
process that handles
data requests

11
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,850
and manages data access.

12
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,440
We'll also cover
important aspects

13
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,900
of deploying a single Mongod
process, such as enabling

14
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,290
authentication and
exploring the database logs.

15
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,790
In the second
chapter, we'll discuss

16
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,710
how MongoDB supports
high availability

17
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,510
by replicating our data.

18
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,450
With multiple copies of data
on different database servers,

19
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,520
replication provides a
level of fault tolerance

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,915
against the loss of a
single database server.

21
00:00:41,915 --> 00:00:44,290
In this course, we'll go
through the general architecture

22
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,960
and behavior of a replica set,
and the different deployment

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,250
strategies you can use to
better suit your application.

24
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,820
In the final chapter,
we'll discuss

25
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,920
scalability and
how MongoDB scales

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,080
horizontally through sharding.

27
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,150
In this course, we're
going to cover topics

28
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,550
like the architecture
of a sharded cluster,

29
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,640
how queries are handled, and how
to choose the way your data is

30
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,740
distributed.

31
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,550
This course is
three chapters long.

32
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,750
And with each chapter, there'll
be a new set of lesson videos.

33
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,460
After each lesson,
there will be a quiz

34
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,010
to assess your learning
of the material.

35
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,410
Lab exercises are dispersed
throughout each chapter

36
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,020
so that you can apply what
you've learned throughout.

37
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,020
So let's go over a few logistics
of the course very quickly.

38
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,642
Who's the target audience?

39
00:01:24,642 --> 00:01:25,600
This is a basic course.

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,558
So it's suitable for
people on both development

41
00:01:27,558 --> 00:01:29,380
and administration teams.

42
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,780
It's expected that you already
have some basic knowledge

43
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,720
or understanding of databases
or a basic familiarity

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,040
with MongoDB.

45
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,589
For example, if you took
M001 on MongoDB University,

46
00:01:39,589 --> 00:01:42,130
and you feel comfortable with
what you learned in that class,

47
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,180
then you're in the right place.

48
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,800
How does the grading work?

49
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,080
There are quizzes,
labs, and a final exam

50
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,500
as deliverables on your
part during the course.

51
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,980
1/2 of your grade
in the class will

52
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,900
be determined by how
you do in the labs,

53
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,275
and the other half will be
determined by your performance

54
00:01:56,275 --> 00:01:57,470
on the final exam.

55
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,420
The quizzes are ungraded
and they exist mainly

56
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,840
to help you track your own
understanding of the material.

57
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,850
Students with a grade
of 65% or greater

58
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,070
will receive a passing
grade and a certificate

59
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,840
of course completion.

60
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,639
Throughout the course,
we highly encourage

61
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,260
you to participate in
the discussion forum.

62
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,200
We provide knowledgeable
teaching assistants

63
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,210
who are there to help
answer your questions.

64
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,250
But you also have
your fellow classmates

65
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,530
who are often very
helpful resources, as they

66
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,020
take the course alongside you.

67
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,820
By the end of this
course, you should

68
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,120
be familiar with the different
tools and techniques used

69
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,910
to administer basic
MongoDB deployments.

70
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,790
You'll be able to identify
different MongoDB architectures

71
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,500
and use the MongoDB
shell to configure them.

72
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,320
So without further
ado, thank you

73
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,850
for deciding to learn with us.

74
00:02:40,850 --> 00:00:00,000
And we wish you
the best of luck.
