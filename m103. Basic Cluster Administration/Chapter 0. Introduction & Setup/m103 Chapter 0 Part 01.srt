1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,367


2
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:02,200
So the labs in this
course will be completed

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,924
inside a virtual machine.

4
00:00:03,924 --> 00:00:06,340
And this lesson is about how
to set up the virtual machine

5
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,570
on your host machine.

6
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,990
But first, why are we using one?

7
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,450
The first is that it's to
sandbox the environment.

8
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,620
We want to give you an
environment that you

9
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,329
can use without messing
with the existing

10
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,640
settings on your local machine.

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,190
This also allows us to
avoid dependency and system

12
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,460
troubleshooting.

13
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,550
So all the dependencies
are downloaded for you.

14
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,930
And you can focus
on the learning.

15
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,070
Third, it also allows us to
provide more consistent support

16
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,049
for our students
throughout the course.

17
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,257
If we know that everyone's
running the same operating

18
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:36,850
system, we can more quickly
diagnose and solve problems

19
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,030
that you have.

20
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,460
So how does it work?

21
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,420
You boot up a Vagrant virtual
machine on your computer.

22
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,690
And it uses your
computer's memory, storage,

23
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,930
and CPU in order to function
just like a real computer.

24
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,260
And by using a process
called SSH, or Secure Shell,

25
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,147
you can connect to
the virtual machine.

26
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:56,980
Once you're connected,
you can treat it just

27
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,260
like a regular computer.

28
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,630
And you can connect it with
your terminal or command prompt.

29
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,140
In this course, you'll launch
mongod processes and replica

30
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,150
sets all inside your
virtual machine.

31
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,700
But in order to do
that, we're going

32
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,860
to ask that you install
two dependencies.

33
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,320
The first is VirtualBox.

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,000
VirtualBox as an open
source hypervisor

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,240
that allows us to run virtual
machines on your host machine.

36
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,700
The second is Vagrant, which
is an open source tool that

37
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,950
allows us to build and
maintain these virtual software

38
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,240
environments very quickly.

39
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,220
More specifically, Vagrant
makes it really easy

40
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,940
to copy files and share
files from your host machine

41
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,070
to your virtual machine.

42
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,610
For example, if you had an
exercise handout or some code

43
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,050
that you wrote on
your local machine,

44
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,470
you can take those files
and copy them directly

45
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,270
into the virtual machine.

46
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,590
We'll see more about
this in a minute.

47
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,090
As part of the
lecture notes, you'll

48
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,215
find the instructions to
install these two software

49
00:01:49,215 --> 00:01:50,001
tools for Windows.

50
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:51,500
So I won't be
spending too much time

51
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,880
in this video regarding that.

52
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,460
But once you have
those installed,

53
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,079
we'll start setting up the
virtual class environment.

54
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,870
So first, we're going
to create a directory

55
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,510
for this course called
m103 and a parent directory

56
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,040
called university.

57
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,000
This -p here creates the parent
directory university in case

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,430
it doesn't exist.

59
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,530
So here we have
a recursive copy,

60
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,290
which is notated
by the -r, which

61
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,360
is used to copy
entire directories

62
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,010
into another location.

63
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,900
In this case, we're copying
the m103-vagrant-env directory

64
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,370
into the m103 folder.

65
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,120
So now that we're inside
the m103 vagrant environment

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,364
folder inside the
m103 course folder,

67
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:34,280
we can start looking
around the actual handout

68
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,510
to see what we just downloaded.

69
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:43,310
As we can see, we have a Vagrant
file and a provisioning file.

70
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,930
The Vagrant file
specifies some baseline

71
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,817
operating system image details.

72
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:49,650
As you can see, we have
the operating system

73
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,919
that we're running, Ubuntu.

74
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,460
And I just want to quickly draw
your attention to this folder

75
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,560
that we created called Shared.

76
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,430
This folder is going to connect
our virtual machine to our host

77
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,470
machine.

78
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,350
So at any point, if you want
to copy a file from your host

79
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,910
machine into the
virtual machine,

80
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,940
be it a handout for
a lab or some code

81
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,640
that you wrote on your host
machine, all you'd have to do

82
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,790
is copy it in the shared folder
inside the virtual environment

83
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,089
and it would copy it
into the virtual machine.

84
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:18,630
There are some other
details in here,

85
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,650
such as the name of
the box, mongod-m103,

86
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,640
and the amount of memory, which
is just over two gigabytes.

87
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,560
There's also an
external IP address

88
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,690
for the Vagrant box,
192.168.103.100,

89
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,050
which you'll actually have
to use in some later labs.

90
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,250
So now we can take a look
at the provisioning file

91
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,680
and see what's inside.

92
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,180
This file is quite a bit
longer than the Vagrant file.

93
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,710
And it's written in
Shell script because it

94
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,126
needs to download some things
in order for you to complete

95
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,350
the course materials.

96
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,742
The provisioning file overall
specifies the dependencies

97
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:51,200
and all the necessary
software that

98
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
will be required to
complete the labs.

99
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
And it will also download
the validation scripts

100
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,552
you'll run in order
to check your work.

101
00:03:57,552 --> 00:03:59,010
We have some commands
here defining

102
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,680
which version of
MongoDB to install

103
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,680
and where to place some
files and configurations

104
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,590
and any third-party software.

105
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,804
You don't really need to
know any of this stuff.

106
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:08,220
But just in case
something does go

107
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,479
wrong with the virtual
environment during the course,

108
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,020
we might ask you to change some
of the settings and variables

109
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,319
inside these files.

110
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,110
The chances of that
are very small, though.

111
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,454
So in general, try not to
mess around with these files.

112
00:04:18,454 --> 00:04:19,829
The reason we're
using Vagrant is

113
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,230
so that you can focus on
the course material and not

114
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,387
dependencies or any
of that other stuff.

115
00:04:24,387 --> 00:04:25,970
So now that we've
taken a look at some

116
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,664
of the files you
got in the handout,

117
00:04:27,664 --> 00:04:29,330
we actually bring
Vagrant up and go over

118
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,000
some of the commands you can
use to configure the Vagrant

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,220
box once it's running.

120
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,430
The first that we're going to
learn is called vagrant up.

121
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,010
This is going to actually
bring our box up as specified

122
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,005
in the Vagrant file and
the provisioning file.

123
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:43,866
This may take a while to
run, especially if it's

124
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:44,660
your first time running it.

125
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,743
So just wait a few minutes
and it should complete.

126
00:04:46,743 --> 00:04:50,120


127
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,620
So once this box
is running, we can

128
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,790
check the health and status
of the box using the command

129
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,930
vagrant status.

130
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,664
This tells us that our
mongod-m103 box is running.

131
00:05:01,664 --> 00:05:03,080
And it also gives
us some commands

132
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,410
that we can use to shut
it down with vagrant halt,

133
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,490
suspend it with vagrant
suspend, and start it

134
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,510
back up with vagrant up.

135
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,090
Without further ado,
let's SSH into the box.

136
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,720
So here we can connect
to the box using the SSH

137
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,000
with the command vagrant ssh.

138
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,490
This will recognize the Vagrant
file and provisioning file

139
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,636
and use it to connect
to the right VirtualBox.

140
00:05:24,636 --> 00:05:27,830


141
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,395
So once we've
SSHed, you can tell

142
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,770
that the Shell
prompt has changed

143
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,830
to say vagrant and m103.

144
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,252
And this is a good thing.

145
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:36,710
It means that we're no longer
connected to our host machine

146
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,251
and we're actually
connected directly

147
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:39,240
to the virtual machine.

148
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,310
And we can run commands
to actually explore

149
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,590
our virtual machine.

150
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,020
We'll just take a look
at the mongod version

151
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,970
that's installed on our box.

152
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,069
And we can see it's version
3.6, which is the latest.

153
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:52,610
This is because the provisioning
file went and got the latest

154
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,060
version of MongoDB for us.

155
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,206
So we didn't have to
figure out how to do it.

156
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:57,830
It also installed on
the right location

157
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,600
so that you can jump
right in and start

158
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,580
running Mongo commands.

159
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,080
If we want to exit the box,
all we have to do is type exit

160
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,660
and we're connected back
to our host machine.

161
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,606
If we want to stop the box,
we can run vagrant halt.

162
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,980
And this will gracefully shut
down our virtual machine so

163
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,110
that the state stays the same.

164
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,260
And if we run vagrant up
again, it'll bring it back up.

165
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,570
We can verify this by
running vagrant status again.

166
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,240
And as we can see,
the box is running.

167
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,210
So just to recap, here's
what will be expected of you.

168
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,270
Download the handout
that contains the Vagrant

169
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,250
environment.

170
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,320
Unzip the handout and place
it in your new m103 folder

171
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,410
for this course.

172
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,920
You can bring the virtual
environment up with vagrant up,

173
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,720
and they connect with SSH.

174
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,640
In order to verify the
provisioning script ran

175
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,295
the correct way, you can
check the version of MongoDB

176
00:06:50,295 --> 00:06:53,140
that's installed inside
the virtual machine.

177
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,020
If you want, you can exit the
box and put our system to rest,

178
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,530
and then bring it back up
again so that you can use it.

179
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,130
All right.

180
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,210
Thanks for listening.

181
00:07:00,210 --> 00:00:00,000
Good luck setting up your
own virtual environment.
