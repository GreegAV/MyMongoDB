1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.320
Organizations are
increasingly storing

3
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.810
sensitive personally
identifiable information, PII,

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.920
on MongoDB and are
facing the challenge

5
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.800
of complying with
security policies

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.110
and external regulations
such as HIPA, PCI and FERPA.

7
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.340
These policies usually
require encryption on disk

8
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.990
when storing sensitive
or private data in order

9
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.650
to protect it from being
accessed by unauthorized users.

10
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.200
In order to address these
regulated use cases,

11
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.480
MongoDB offers database
file encryption

12
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.940
as part of its
enterprise offering.

13
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.830
MongoDB 3.4 is further
strengthening its data

14
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.010
protection offering
by adding an option

15
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.120
to redact client data
from the system log files.

16
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.300
Additionally, log
assertions will contain

17
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.100
no content in this mode.

18
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.200
Rather the source
file and line number

19
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.690
will be provided instead.

20
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.920
This option will prevent
potentially sensitive data

21
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.450
from being written
to system logs, which

22
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.700
are stored and encrypted.

23
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.360
This will greatly simplify
the best practices

24
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.820
for deploying MongoDB
in regular environments

25
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.640
and helps to ensure PII data
is protected where possible.

26
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.620
There are important
supportability trade-offs,

27
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.320
though, to redacting client
data from the system logs.

28
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.880
The new option will redact
all values from documents.

29
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.740
Therefore, the
logs will only show

30
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.280
the set of keys queried against
without the actual values used

31
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.640
to filter.

32
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.890
While still helpful,
this will weaken

33
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.580
the power of our
system logs from

34
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.260
a diagnosability standpoint.

35
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.500
Now, let's have a look
to some examples where

36
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.280
we can see the configuration
options and trade-offs

37
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.750
while enabling log redaction.
