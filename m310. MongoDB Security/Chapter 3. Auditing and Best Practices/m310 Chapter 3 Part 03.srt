2
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.300
In this video, we're going
to talk about audit filters.

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.000
And so by now, you might be
asking yourself the question,

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.760
what is logged by default
when we have auditing enabled?

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.760
And we already know that
there are four categories

6
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.570
of events that can be logged
through MongoDB's auditing

7
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.010
system.

8
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.090
There are Schema,
or DDL, Operations.

9
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.390
There are Replica Set and
Sharded Cluster Operations.

10
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.870
There are Authentication and
Authorization Operations.

11
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.030
And finally, there are CRUD,
also known as DML, Operations.

12
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.180
But by default, we only
audit these three categories.

13
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.430
And the reason this
is is the same reason

14
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.100
we have audit filters
in the first place.

15
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.590
And that's because when
we audit everything,

16
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.330
we have too many logs.

17
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.210
And we also have
performance loss.

18
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.040
We have performance loss
because we're constantly writing

19
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.590
to disk for every operation.

20
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.170
That's why CRUD is not
audited by default,

21
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.239
even when auditing is enabled.

22
00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.830
If CRUD was enabled by default,
then virtually every operation

23
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.369
on your database would
have an additional write.

24
00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.910
And those additional
writes are going

25
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.190
to make you lose performance
on your database.

26
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.110
And moreover, we just
have too many logs.

27
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.640
We were just logging
so much stuff,

28
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.960
it's hard to even
know what's going on.

29
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.490
And that's why
audit filters exist.

30
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.350
Audit filters, like the
logs that they describe,

31
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.060
are defined in JSON.

32
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.841
We specify an audit filter
using a filter document.

33
00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:34.340
As you can see,
this filter document

34
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.020
is pretty straightforward.

35
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.670
Here, we're creating
a filter document

36
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.760
where we want to log any time
that there's a createCollection

37
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.250
or dropCollection, atype.

38
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.130
Essentially, all we're doing
is writing a query document

39
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.080
with the MongoDB
query language as

40
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.980
if we are querying these logs.
