00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.580
In this video, I'd like to talk
about vulnerability reports

3
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.950
with MongoDB.

4
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.950
At MongoDB, we take the security
of our database very seriously.

5
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.990
A part of our mission
to keep MongoDB secure

6
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.764
includes vulnerability
reporting from our users.

7
00:00:16.764 --> 00:00:18.180
If you believe you
have discovered

8
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.210
a vulnerability in MongoDB,
or have experienced a security

9
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.530
incident related to MongoDB,
please report the issue

10
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.710
to aid in its resolution.

11
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.840
We've tried to make
reporting of vulnerability

12
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.840
as easy as possible.

13
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.100
There are two ways to
report a potential MongoDB

14
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.590
vulnerability.

15
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.370
The first way, which is the
recommended notification

16
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.010
method, is to submit a
ticket to the SECURITY

17
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.140
Project on our JIRA.

18
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.250
The second way is to
simply just send an email

19
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.600
to security@mongodb.com.

20
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.350
If you would like to
encrypt your message,

21
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.790
you can use our PGP public
key encryption, which

22
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.700
will be linked below the video.

23
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.860
All vulnerability
reports will be

24
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.380
responded to within 48 hours.

25
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.240
In order to best serve
MongoDB's security

26
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.100
team and our developers,
all vulnerability reports

27
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.680
should contain as much
information as possible.

28
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.600
And in particular,
these following items

29
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.641
are highly recommended.

30
00:01:09.641 --> 00:01:11.390
Of course, you're going
to want to include

31
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.306
the name of the product
that you've identified

32
00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:14.840
a potential issue with.

33
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.170
And then next, you can include
any common vulnerability

34
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.350
information.

35
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.200
If there's a CVSS score, which,
if you're not familiar with,

36
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.340
is a score from one to
10, 10 being the worst,

37
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.270
that rates the severity
of a vulnerability.

38
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.950
If the vulnerability is a
publicly- or commonly-known

39
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.160
type of vulnerability, then
please also include the CVE,

40
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.690
the Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures identifier.

41
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.670
And of course, if you're open
to be contacted by MongoDB

42
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.660
security staff, please
include any necessary contact

43
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.860
information.

44
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.470
If needed, MongoDB
representatives

45
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.660
will serve a conference call to
exchange information regarding

46
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.947
the vulnerability.

47
00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.530
I would like to point
out that MongoDB

48
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.190
takes all of our vulnerability
reports very seriously.

49
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.860
We validate all submitted
vulnerabilities and will

50
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.630
use JIRA to track all
communications regarding

51
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.530
a vulnerability, including
requests for clarification

52
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.509
or additional information.

53
00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.370
Finally, we ask that if you
find a potential security

54
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.560
vulnerability, that
you do not publicly

55
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.750
disclose any information
regarding the vulnerability

56
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.495
or exploit the issue.

57
00:02:19.495 --> 00:02:20.870
This will give us
the opportunity

58
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.660
to analyze the vulnerability,
to respond to the notification,

59
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.050
and to notify key users,
customers, and partners.

60
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.660
The amount of time required
to validate a reported

61
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.250
vulnerability depends
on the complexity

62
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.970
and the severity of the issue.

63
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.600
We take all vulnerabilities
very seriously.

64
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.100
And we will always
ensure that there

65
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.380
is a clear and open
channel of communication

66
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.340
with the reporter.

67
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.460
After validating
an issue, MongoDB

68
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.470
will coordinate a public
disclosure of the issue

69
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.700
with the reporter in
a mutually-agreed time

70
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.830
frame and format.

71
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.590
If required or requested, the
reporter of a vulnerability

72
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.020
will receive credit in the
published security bulletin.
