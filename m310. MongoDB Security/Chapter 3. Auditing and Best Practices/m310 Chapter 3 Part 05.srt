00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960


2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,410
In this video, we're going
to talk about auditing DDL.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,109
With traditional SQL
databases, SQL statements

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,790
generally fall under
one of two categories.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,900
A statement is either a DDL--
a Data Definition Language

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,230
statement or DML--
Data Manipulation

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,150
Language statement.

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,130
As you can imagine,
DDL statements

9
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,990
are statements
that make a change

10
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,850
to the schema of a database.

11
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,610
Whereas, DML statements
manipulate the actual data

12
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,100
within them.

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,900
While MongoDB has a flexible
schema, which could potentially

14
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,590
imply that there is no DDL,
the MongoDB query language

15
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,070
actually supports
several DDL operations.

16
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,920
Here's a short list
of a few action types

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,580
that the auditing system uses
that would fall under DDL.

18
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,280
We have things like
createIndex, createDatabase,

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,580
renameCollection,
dropDatabase, et cetera.

20
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,470
If you actually look
at all the action types

21
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,320
that the MongoDB
auditing system supports,

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,970
you'll notice most
of them are actually

23
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,350
related to DDL rather
than DML operations.

24
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,440
This is because, for the most
part, auditing within MongoDB

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,460
is designed to
monitor changes made

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:00:00,000
to the actual configuration
of our databases.
