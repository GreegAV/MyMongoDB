2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.830
In this video, we're going
to talk about auditing

3
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.820
with MongoDB.

4
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.770
Auditing is an enterprise
feature of MongoDB.

5
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.380
And for certain organizations
and administrators,

6
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.010
auditing is a very
important part

7
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.970
of security infrastructure.

8
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.410
Auditing can be used
for a myriad of things.

9
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.130
But from a security
perspective, it

10
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.130
is most often used for the
following three things.

11
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.520
First, it's often used
for accountability

12
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.480
of the users of our database.

13
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.140
Auditing is also commonly
used to investigate

14
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.840
suspicious activity.

15
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.350
And finally, it is used
to monitor and gather

16
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.690
data about specific
database activities.

17
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.760
Once enabled, the
auditing system

18
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.250
can record four different
categories of operations.

19
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.470
First, we can monitor
schema modification, or DDL.

20
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.910
We can also audit the
management and configuration

21
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.000
operations used to configure
our replica sets and sharded

22
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.730
clusters.

23
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.307
Of course, we can also audit the
access to our database as well

24
00:00:56.307 --> 00:00:58.140
as the authorization
[? within ?] [? side ?]

25
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.640
of our database.

26
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.210
And finally, we can even
audit CRUD operations

27
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.040
on our database.
