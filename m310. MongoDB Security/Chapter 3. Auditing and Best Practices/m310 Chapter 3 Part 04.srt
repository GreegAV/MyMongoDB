00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.620
Now let's go ahead and
use our last example

3
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.490
and actually go ahead
and try out this filter.

4
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.230
In this video, we're going
to go ahead and build off

5
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.420
of the example we
saw in the last video

6
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.060
and actually try and
test out this filter.

7
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.120
If you remember from last time,
we created an audit filter

8
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.930
where we monitored creating
or dropping collections.

9
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.320
Let's go ahead and start the
MongoDB for this audit filter.

10
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.267
I still have my configuration
file from a previous video,

11
00:00:26.267 --> 00:00:28.600
so let's go ahead and just
add the audit filter directly

12
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.320
into this file.

13
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.780
So here is our
configuration file.

14
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.870
We just need to add a line
that looks like this where

15
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.290
we specify a filter, and then
we define the audit filter

16
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.124
that we've made.

17
00:00:40.124 --> 00:00:42.040
And now, like before,
we can go ahead and just

18
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.090
run with --config, our
configuration file, and --fork.

19
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.820
Now, I do want to point out, if
we didn't use a configuration

20
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.600
file, we could use the
--auditFilter option,

21
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.700
like so, and then just pass
a string to this option.

22
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.450
But since we've
already specified that,

23
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.220
we can just hit enter.

24
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.390
Now we'll go ahead
and tail our log.

25
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.640
And you can see that, so
far, there's nothing in here.

26
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.880
And now, in our last example,
we tried to authenticate,

27
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.352
and that showed
in the audit log.

28
00:01:11.352 --> 00:01:13.060
So let's first
authenticate and make sure

29
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.143
that that doesn't show up.

30
00:01:14.143 --> 00:01:16.842
And when I hit Enter, we see
that the authentication failed.

31
00:01:16.842 --> 00:01:18.800
And when I go back to
log, we shouldn't see it.

32
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.530
And, awesome, we don't see it.

33
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.395
However, if I try to
create a collection now,

34
00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:27.500
and I run db.createCollection
with a test collection,

35
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.940
it says, OK.

36
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.690
And, right here, we
can see our audit log.

37
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.800
We have an atype of
createCollection.

38
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.320
We have our time stamp,
our local, our remote.

39
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.820
And then, of course,
we actually see

40
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.069
the params that are passed in.

41
00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:40.000
So the namespace,
or the collection

42
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.370
that we're trying to create,
was on the test.t database,

43
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.145
and it was a collection
called "testcoll."

44
00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:45.520
Of course, we
don't actually have

45
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.930
to run the
createCollection command.

46
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.840
MongoDB has a flexible schema.

47
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.625
So you'll create a
collection on the fly.

48
00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:54.500
You can see here, I can
show the collections.

49
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.050
You see our test collection.

50
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.650
And I can also just run
db.insert on a collection that

51
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.030
doesn't exist yet.

52
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.420
And MongoDB will dynamically run
createCollection on our behalf.

53
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.300
And so we should
see that in the log.

54
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.009
And we do.

55
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.110
There's our other
createCollection.
