Organizations are increasingly storing sensitive personally identifiable information, PII, on MongoDB and are facing the challenge of complying with security policies and external regulations such as HIPA, PCI and FERPA.

These policies usually require encryption on disk when storing sensitive or private data in order to protect it from being accessed by unauthorized users.

In order to address these regulated use cases, MongoDB offers database file encryption as part of its enterprise offering.

MongoDB 3.4 is further strengthening its data protection offering by adding an option to redact client data from the system log files.

Additionally, log assertions will contain no content in this mode.

Rather the source file and line number will be provided instead.

This option will prevent potentially sensitive data from being written to system logs, which are stored and encrypted.

This will greatly simplify the best practices for deploying MongoDB in regular environments and helps to ensure PII data is protected where possible.

There are important supportability trade-offs, though, to redacting client data from the system logs.

The new option will redact all values from documents.

Therefore, the logs will only show the set of keys queried against without the actual values used to filter.

While still helpful, this will weaken the power of our system logs from a diagnosability standpoint.

Now, let's have a look to some examples where we can see the configuration options and trade-offs while enabling log redaction.
