00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.490
Now that we've looked at
how to audit DDL operations,

3
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.470
let's take a moment and look
at how to audit DML operations.

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.690
The other common
statement category in SQL

5
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.980
is DML, or Data
Manipulation Language.

6
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.440
As the name implies, DML
refers to the manipulation

7
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.020
of data within your database.

8
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.050
With MongoDB, we generally
refer to DML operations

9
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.820
as CRUD-- the ability to
create, read, update, and delete

10
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.020
our data.

11
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.555
With regards to auditing
DML, virtually all

12
00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:34.590
of the operations that we
would consider DML operations

13
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.890
fall underneath the
authCheck action type.

14
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.030
This is because CRUD operations
are passed as parameters

15
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.230
to the authCheck event.

16
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.970
Every time that you try to
create, read, update or destroy

17
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.652
data within your
database, authCheck

18
00:00:50.652 --> 00:00:52.860
is going to be the action
type that's actually firing

19
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.280
from an auditing perspective.
