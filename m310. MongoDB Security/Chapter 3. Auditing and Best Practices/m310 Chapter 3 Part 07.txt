Now that we've looked at how to audit DDL operations, let's take a moment and look at how to audit DML operations.

The other common statement category in SQL is DML, or Data Manipulation Language.

As the name implies, DML refers to the manipulation of data within your database.

With MongoDB, we generally refer to DML operations as CRUD-- the ability to create, read, update, and delete our data.

With regards to auditing DML, virtually all of the operations that we would consider DML operations fall underneath the authCheck action type.

This is because CRUD operations are passed as parameters to the authCheck event.

Every time that you try to create, read, update or destroy data within your database, authCheck is going to be the action type that's actually firing from an auditing perspective.
