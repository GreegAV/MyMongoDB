In this video, we're going to talk about auditing with MongoDB.

Auditing is an enterprise feature of MongoDB.

And for certain organizations and administrators, auditing is a very important part of security infrastructure.

Auditing can be used for a myriad of things.

But from a security perspective, it is most often used for the following three things.

First, it's often used for accountability of the users of our database.

Auditing is also commonly used to investigate suspicious activity.

And finally, it is used to monitor and gather data about specific database activities.

Once enabled, the auditing system can record four different categories of operations.

First, we can monitor schema modification, or DDL.

We can also audit the management and configuration operations used to configure our replica sets and sharded clusters.

Of course, we can also audit the access to our database as well as the authorization [?

within ?] [?

side ?] of our database.

And finally, we can even audit CRUD operations on our database.
