00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.499


2
00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.230
Before we get
started talking about

3
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.520
the different
authentication mechanisms

4
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.040
the MongoDB supports,
I want to clarify

5
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.460
a common point of confusion.

6
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.905
Authentication and
authorization are commonly

7
00:00:11.905 --> 00:00:14.030
interchanged with one
another, but they're actually

8
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.610
two very different things.

9
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.720
Authentication is
the process by which

10
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.780
we verify the
identity of a user,

11
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.590
whereas authorization is the
process by which we verify

12
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.170
the privileges of a user.

13
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.360
The best way to think about it
is that authentication answers

14
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.280
the question, who are you?

15
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.290
Whereas authorization
answers the question,

16
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.050
what do you have access to?

17
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.950
I can be authenticated
to a system,

18
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.720
but I might not be authorized
to control a certain resource.

19
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.860
Authentication enables
us to do authorization.

20
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.500
Once we know who you
are, we can then ask,

21
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.890
what do you have access to?
