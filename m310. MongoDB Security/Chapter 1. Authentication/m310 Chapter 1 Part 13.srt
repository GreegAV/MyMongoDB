1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.790
There are two main components
that we need to configure.

3
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.720
On one side, we're going
to have our LDAP server.

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.140
On the other side, we're
going to have our MongoDB LDAP

5
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.290
configuration options.

6
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.220
They're going to set in our
MongoDB configuration file.

7
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.500
Let's start by analyzing a
sample LDAP configuration file.

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.670
Note that the actual LDAP server
configuration details are out

9
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.420
of scope for this lesson.

10
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.970
This is something that
you need to catch up.

11
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.369
To configure LDAP servers,
we'll be using ldif files.

12
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.900
ldif is a standard
plain data interchange

13
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.810
formats for representing LDAP
directory content and update

14
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.410
requests, conveys directory
content as a set of records,

15
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.350
one record for each object.

16
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.600
It also represents
update requests

17
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.600
such as heading, modifying,
deleting, or even renaming

18
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.060
operations as a set of records.

19
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.350
Now let's assume that we have
this ldif file as supporting

20
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.640
configuration for LDAP servers.

21
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.190
We have a set of groups-- in
this case mongodb.com-- users

22
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.500
NDBA.

23
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.310
And we're going to also
have a set of users

24
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.240
or a couple of users in
this case-- Alice and BOB.

25
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.580
There are several
different types

26
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.060
of [INAUDIBLE],
groups, and users

27
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.750
that we can define using ldifs.

28
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.370
For now, we are just going to be
using this example for the time

29
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.200
being.

30
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.740
For MongoDB configuration,
we have a large set

31
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.932
of different options available
to configure our server.

32
00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:41.970
We'll start with
the LDAP servers,

33
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.010
a comma separated string of
one or more LDAP servers.

34
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.640
We're going to have
LDAP transport security.

35
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.130
It's an option whether
or not to secure

36
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.110
the communications between
LDAP servers and MongoDB.

37
00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.710
Accepted values are
going to be TLS or none.

38
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:10.030
ldapAuthzQueryTemplate-- this
is an rfc4516 formatted URL

39
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.670
of the LDAP Quarry to execute
in order to obtain LDAP groups.

40
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.260
In this URL, the placeholder
token string user

41
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.890
will be replaced with
the queried distinguished

42
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.540
name of the user.

43
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.660
If not set, MongoDB will not
use LDAP for authorization.

44
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.010
Also have LDAP
timeout milliseconds,

45
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.100
the amount of time that MongoDB
should wait for an LDP server

46
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.330
to respond to a request.

47
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.300
The default is 10 seconds.

48
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.900
ldapBindSASLMechanisms--
the SASL mechanisms MongoDB

49
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.390
will attempt to authenticate
with against LDAP server

50
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.190
while binding.

51
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.830
If MongoDB is using
SASL authentication,

52
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.520
it will bind using DIGEST-MD5
by default. ldapQueryUser-- this

53
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.380
is the LDAP entity
distinguished name

54
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.730
that MongoDB will bind as when
connecting to an LDAP server.

55
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.960
And we're also going to
have its password set

56
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.090
by ldapQueryPassword--
again, the password which

57
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.626
MongoDB will use to bind when
connecting to that same LDAP

58
00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:14.820
server.

59
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.840
We also have an
important one-- LDAP user

60
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.290
to distinguish name mapping.

61
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.510
This is an adjacent array
of ordered transformations

62
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.540
that MongoDB will apply to
authenticate MongoDB user

63
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.450
names to match their
distinguished names in LDAP--

64
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.470
useful for when we are using
alternative authentication

65
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.180
method or if user names passed
to MongoDB for authentication

66
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.390
do not match the LDAP DN.

67
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.420
If not defined,
MongoDB will directly

68
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.850
use whatever username you
pass it through to the DN.

69
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.950
This is intended to
allow LDAP authorization

70
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.200
to work automatically.

71
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.770
We're also going to have
LDAP user cache invalidation

72
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.810
interval.

73
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.720
MongoDB will hold the cache
of authenticated users.

74
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.617
During this interval,
it will determine

75
00:03:58.617 --> 00:04:00.200
how much time MongoDB
will [INAUDIBLE]

76
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.490
to wait for external user
caches to be flushed.

77
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.310
The default is 30 seconds.

78
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.570
ldapBindWithOSDefaults
will perform queries

79
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.730
to the service accounts'
username and password.

80
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.649
It's useful for single sign-on
on where you are already

81
00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.930
authenticate against
your OS and you just

82
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.250
want to avoid passing
your username and password

83
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.210
continuously to MongoDB.

84
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.380
Although that said, it is
incompatible with ldapCoreUser

85
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.670
and ldapCorePassword.

86
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.720
For demo purposes,
we'll be using

87
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.870
a very simple configuration.

88
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.890
I'm going to start by defining
and setting the list of LDAP

89
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.220
servers that I'm going to use.

90
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.350
We're going to be setting up a
query template, which is going

91
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.910
to be user member of and base.

92
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.930
We are going to define user
distinguish names mapping

93
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.810
option with a match,
regular expression,

94
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.810
and its substitution string.

95
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.660
In this example,
we are not going

96
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.710
to be using any
transport security

97
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.060
and the binding mechanism is
going to be set to simple.

98
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.320
And since we are using
LDAP for both authorization

99
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.730
and authentication, I'm setting
the authentication mechanism

100
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.970
to plain, which is the
respective authentication

101
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.550
mechanism for LDAP.

102
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.590
Once we have this
configuration in place,

103
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.870
both on LDAP and MongoDB
configuration files,

104
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.170
it will be time to
validate this setup.

105
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.580
But let's talk about that
in the following lesson.
