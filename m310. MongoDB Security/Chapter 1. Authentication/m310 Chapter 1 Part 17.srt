00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.447


2
00:00:00.447 --> 00:00:02.780
In this video we're going to
talk about Kerberos and how

3
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.740
to configure MongoDB to
enable Kerberos authentication

4
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.890
support.

5
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.260
As we said before,
Kerberos is an industry

6
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.330
standard authentication
protocol.

7
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.940
Before talking about
how Kerberos works,

8
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.350
I want to mention that Kerberos
calls users principles,

9
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.780
and this is because
a Kerberos principal

10
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.747
is a unique identity to which
Kerberos can assign tickets.

11
00:00:24.747 --> 00:00:27.080
So when I say principal in
the context of authenticating

12
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.230
to MongoDB, think user.

13
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.299
Kerberos authentication
support works

14
00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.180
by creating a service
principle for MongoDB

15
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.300
inside of the Kerberos KDC.

16
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.310
This enables among
MongoDB driver

17
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.030
to request tickets from the
Kerberos KDC's ticket grading

18
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.150
service, and then once the
driver has that ticket,

19
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.019
it can then use that ticket
to authenticate to MongoDB.

20
00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.060
Let's go ahead and look
at how to enable Kerberos

21
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.950
authentication support.

22
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.630
Here I'm running
a VM that already

23
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.930
has Kerberos installed on it.

24
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.180
I've already created
a user on the KDC.

25
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.860
Let's go ahead,
and check it out.

26
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.040
Here I'm running the
tool kadmin.local.

27
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.140
This allows us to
directly modify

28
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.500
the Kerberos KDC's database.

29
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.390
Now here we can go ahead
and list all the principles

30
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.010
on this machine.

31
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.010
Here's the command to
do so-- listprincs,

32
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.470
which is short for principles.

33
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.720
And as you can see, I've
already created a principal

34
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.790
for kirby-- kirby@MONGODB.COM.

35
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.230
Now we need to go ahead and
add a principal for MongoDB so

36
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.300
that we can issue
tickets to our users,

37
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.210
so they can authenticate
with MongoDB.

38
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.720
And here's the command to do so.

39
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.960
I'm going to go ahead
and add a principal.

40
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.140
I'm going to generate a
random key for this principle.

41
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.510
And the naming here of the
principle is very important.

42
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.770
The first is the name of
the service-- in this case,

43
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.610
MongoDB-- followed by a slash,
and then after the slash,

44
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.980
we have the host name
of the server that

45
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.080
is running our database.

46
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.600
Now that we have our
principal created for MongoDB,

47
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.180
we can generate a key
tab, which is a file that

48
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.420
will contain our shared secret.

49
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.780
We'll eventually put this
on our database server

50
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.160
so that MongoDB and Kerberos
can share the secret.

51
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.520
Here's the command to
generate the key tab-- key

52
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.760
tab add dash k, the
name of the key tab

53
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.250
file-- in this case, the
MongoDB dot key tab-- and then

54
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.230
the name of our principal.

55
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.200
Now we can go and
close kadmin.local,

56
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.300
and you can see our file.

57
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.570
And here is our key tab, and I'm
going to go ahead and copy this

58
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.920
over to our database server.

59
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.850
I'm now on our database
server, and here's my key tab

60
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.870
that we just generated
on the other server.

61
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.490
I'm now going to
store its location

62
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.860
in an environmental
variable called KRB5_KTNAME,

63
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.750
and this is so that
MongoDB actually

64
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.900
knows where this file is.

65
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.940
Great, now the last thing
we do before starting

66
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.234
MongoDB is just to configure
this server to talk to our KDC.

67
00:02:58.234 --> 00:02:59.900
I've already installed
the basic program

68
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.420
to authenticate to
Kerberos with apt-get.

69
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.270
We just need to modify
the configuration file.

70
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.980
And here's the
location of the file.

71
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.790
Etc krb5.conf.

72
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.980
I'm going to use them to edit
it and run sudo because we're

73
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.280
operating with a NetC file.

74
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.140
And there's a lot of
stuff going on in here,

75
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.690
but we only need to modify
three places-- libdefaults,

76
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.095
where we want to change our
default realm to MONGODB.COM.

77
00:03:23.095 --> 00:03:23.595
Awesome.

78
00:03:23.595 --> 00:03:26.560


79
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.250
The second place
is under realms.

80
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.640
Here we want to go ahead and add
the information for our MongoDB

81
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.990
realm.

82
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.420
Great, and here's
this information.

83
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.910
We have the KDC, the
host name of our KDC,

84
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.618
which is in this case
is infrastructure.m

85
00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:43.190
310.university.mongodb.com
This is the server

86
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.440
that we just ran
the other commands

87
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.810
to generate our key tab file.

88
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.710
And then obviously
the admin server,

89
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.110
which again is on
the same machine.

90
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.300
And the last bit that we need
to add is the domain realm.

91
00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.800
And here we specify .mongodb.com
is equal to MONGODB.COM,

92
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.540
and mongodb.com
equals MONGODB.COM.

93
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.740
All of this stuff is case
sensitive, by the way.

94
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.710
Let's go ahead and
save this file.

95
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.519
Now he can go ahead and
enable Kerberos authentication

96
00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:13.060
with MongoDB.

97
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.980
And here's the command to do so.

98
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.980
We're going to go ahead
and enable authentication,

99
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.990
and then we're going to
set the authentication

100
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.670
mechanism to GSSAPI.

101
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.630
API And this is the mechanism
that is used by Kerberos.

102
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.060
Our server is now
up and running,

103
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.310
and we can go ahead and
connect with the MongoDB shell

104
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.510
and create our Kerberos
principal user.

105
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.767
First we want to switch
to the external database,

106
00:04:34.767 --> 00:04:36.600
and now that we're on
the external database,

107
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.510
we can go ahead and
create our user.

108
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.910
And here's the command
to do so-- db.createUser.

109
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.430
I pass in kirby@MONGODB.COM,
our principal user as our user.

110
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.414
I do not specify a password,
and then I give them

111
00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:50.330
whatever rules I want.

112
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.410
In this case,
userAdminAnyDatabase.

113
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.260
Awesome.

114
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.850
Our user has now been
successfully added.

115
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.840
Now if I go ahead and
try to run db.auth,

116
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.650
specifying the GSSAPI mechanism
with my principal name,

117
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.650
you'll see that this failed.

118
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.350
And this is because we haven't
yet authenticated to Kerberos.

119
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.270
So let's go ahead and
exit out of the shell

120
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.480
and authenticate to Kerberos.

121
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.550
We authenticate
Kerberos with kinit

122
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.904
and then my principal
name, which is just kirby.

123
00:05:19.904 --> 00:05:23.370
And it'll now asked me
for kirby's password,

124
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.470
which I happen to know because
I created it on the KDC.

125
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.510
I've now authenticated
it with Kerberos,

126
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.640
and we can now go
ahead and try again

127
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.080
to authenticate to MongoDB
using my Kerberos credentials.

128
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.660
Again, we'll have to switch
the external database,

129
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.090
and again we can
try to run db.auth

130
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.840
with the GSSAPI mechanism
with my principal name.

131
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.860
And there we go.

132
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.500
We have now successfully
authenticated to MongoDB

133
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.740
using our Kerberos credentials.
