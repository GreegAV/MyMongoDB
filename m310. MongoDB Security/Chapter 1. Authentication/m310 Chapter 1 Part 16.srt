00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.040
In this video, I want to cover
a couple of important issues.

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.610
First, the way we use TLS/SSL
between MongoDB and LDAP

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.090
server.

5
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.630
Second one is how LDAP
configuration differences

6
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.560
between different
LDAP providers and how

7
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.720
this can affect the MongoDB
configuration settings.

8
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.720
Now the use of the TLS
between MongoDB and LDAP

9
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.550
server is enforced by default.
You can, however, disable it,

10
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.860
but we will strongly
recommend it to our users

11
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.540
to keep it enabled.

12
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.610
We can also bind a
node to a given user.

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.460
This will mean that all requests
exchanged between MongoDB

14
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.440
and the LDAP server will be
bound to a username password.

15
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.130
You can also define with the
bind mechanism which mechanism

16
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.140
to use enforcing that bind.

17
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.110
By default, it's set to play.

18
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.160
Now regarding
different LDAP servers,

19
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.500
we will check the most common
used ones-- Active Directory

20
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.880
and OpenLDAP.

21
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.310
To simplify our examples--
the ones used in this course--

22
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.790
we have been playing
around with OpenLDAP.

23
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.440
The labs, the
demonstrations, and some

24
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.480
of the configuration
code snippets

25
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.710
have all been around OpenLDAP.

26
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.500
But there are slight differences
in format and configuration

27
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.730
options depending on which
system we are bound to use.

28
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.550
The most common
MongoDB LDAP deployment

29
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.410
is using Active Directory
as our LDAP server.

30
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.180
This has a set of
different variations

31
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.410
when compared with OpenLDAP.

32
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.270
The first difference resides on
the user definition attributes.

33
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.640
OpenLDAP that assumes
that users will

34
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.870
be defined by UID attributes,
while Active Directory allows

35
00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.530
users to be configured using
a common name-- CN attribute.

36
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.730
This might seem a small,
insignificant difference,

37
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.910
but can cause some headaches
when debugging configuration

38
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.759
validation.

39
00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.960
The other major significant is
around MongoDB configuration

40
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.470
option-- security LDAP
authz query template.

41
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.120
Active Directory
allows us to define

42
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.770
the complete distinguished
name structure

43
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.740
and just replace the username
on the user placeholder.

44
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.030
For example, our query template
can be something like cn=

45
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.050
the placeholder and then the
rest of our distinguished name

46
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.840
definition.

47
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.360
In OpenLDAP, this
is not possible.

48
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.940
We need to use a
full replacement

49
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.930
and use a full
distinguished name.

50
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.690
While in OpenLDAP this is
not possible to achieve

51
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.240
relying alone on the
query template definition,

52
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.620
we can still do this
by applying a user

53
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.890
to DN mapping substitution
on a regular expression.

54
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.350
User to DN option
matching a substitution

55
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.590
and matching regular expression
is the way to get it done.

56
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.740
Why this is important?

57
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.500
If we want users to log in to
MongoDB just passing a user

58
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.390
credential and not the complete
LDAP credentials-- like,

59
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.380
for example, when we have Alice,
or when we have to pass along

60
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.880
UID=Alice and so forth in
the distinguished name.

61
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.930
Which, as you can
imagine, tends to be

62
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.620
a much more pleasant usage.
