Hi there.

3
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.880
Today I'm going to introduce
you to LDAP authorization--

4
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.200
a feature introduced in
3.4 that enhances MongoDB

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.790
overall integration with LDAP.

6
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.060
Prior versions to 3.4
already supported LDAP

7
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.490
for authentication purposes.

8
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.140
This meant that MongoDB
could be configured

9
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.820
to authenticate users using an
external mechanism to MongoDB--

10
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.610
a separate service like LDAP.

11
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.320
Now we can also configure
MongoDB to integrate with LDAP

12
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.009
at authorization level.

13
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.830
Before, we could
validate with LDAP

14
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.870
who the user claimed to be.

15
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.650
Now we can use LDAP to
determine what the user is

16
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.030
allowed to do within MongoDB.

17
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.980
Enabling LDAP for authorization
will allow authentication

18
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.630
via any of the existing external
authentication mechanisms

19
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.430
that MongoDB already supports.

20
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.460
This means that we
can set up MongoDB

21
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.350
to use LDAP authorization.

22
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.335
But we can use an alternate
authentication mechanism--

23
00:01:02.335 --> 00:01:05.830
like Kerberos or x509
certificates-- apart

24
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.410
from the obvious LDAP
for both authentication

25
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.760
and authorization.

26
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.160
With MongoDB 3.4, we also
remove the dependency on SASL

27
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.940
proxy for authentication
with LDAP-- except when

28
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.130
users use PAM mechanism.

29
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.640
For integration with popular
single sign on solutions

30
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.850
like Centerfire and Quest.

31
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.990
In these cases, we still
need to use SASL proxy.

32
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.910
Now let's have a look into the
LDAP authorization mechanism

33
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.460
steps.
