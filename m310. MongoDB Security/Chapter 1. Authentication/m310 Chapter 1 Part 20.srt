00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.230
Let's walk through how to
migrate from MONGODB-CR

3
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.580
to SCRAM-SHA-1.

4
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.000
SCRAM-SHA-1 is highly
recommended over MONGODB-CR.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.280
And you should
only ever encounter

6
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.720
MONGODB-CR on a system
something greater than 3.0

7
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.240
if that system used to be on
an order system, less than 3.0,

8
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.980
and that system was migrated
to a 3.0 or greater system.

9
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.070
The users that were created
on that older system

10
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.430
will still be using MONGODB-CR
until you actually migrate them

11
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.530
over to SCRAM-SHA-1.

12
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.950
All your new users will
still be using SCRAM-SHA-1

13
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.900
on your upgraded system.

14
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.212
Many legacy users will
still be using MONGODB-CR.

15
00:00:41.212 --> 00:00:42.920
So in this video,
we're going to walk you

16
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.280
through the process of how to
migrate those old MONGODB-CR

17
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.220
users over to using
SCRAM-SHA-1, which

18
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.231
is the much more recommended
authentication mechanism.

19
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:53.980
It's important to point
out that upgrading

20
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.350
from MONGODB-CR to
SCRAM-SHA-1 might require

21
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.630
you to upgrade your drivers.

22
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.070
Just make sure
that you understand

23
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.397
what version of drivers
you're currently using

24
00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:05.480
and what authentication
mechanisms those currently

25
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.279
support.

26
00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:08.570
It's just a good thing to
keep in the back of your mind

27
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.740
when going through this process.

28
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.400
Let's go ahead and connect
to our MONGOD instance

29
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.470
and walk you through
the process of how

30
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.030
to migrate over
your old MONGODB-CR

31
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.930
users to SCRAM-SHA-1.

32
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.880
On this computer, I
was recently running

33
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.270
a version of MongoDB 2.6.

34
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.720
On the 2.6 server, I
created a user called Kirby

35
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.850
whose password is password.

36
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.660
I then upgraded
the server to 3.2.

37
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.770
So we should now have a user
in this 3.2 server's database

38
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.330
that is currently using
MONGODB-CR, which is not cool.

39
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.150
We would much rather it
be using SCRAM-SHA-1.

40
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.480
Let's go ahead and switch
to the admin database

41
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.130
and authenticate.

42
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.510
I'm now authenticated.

43
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.390
Let's go ahead and verify
that this user is still

44
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.070
using MONGODB-CR.

45
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.980
In the system.users collection,
we can run find and see

46
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.199
that the Kirby user is
still using MONGODB-CR.

47
00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.850
In order to migrate
over all these users--

48
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.568
in this case just one user--
over to using SCRAM-SHA-1,

49
00:02:13.568 --> 00:02:15.568
we just need to run the
command db.adminCommand(

50
00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:20.480
{authSechemaUpgrade: 1}).

51
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.750
And in running so, it says done.

52
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.750
OK.

53
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.470
And if we look at
our users, we can

54
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.290
see that Kirby is no
longer using MONGODB-CR,

55
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.640
but is rather using SCRAM-SHA-1.

56
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.870
And that's how you migrate
users from using MONGODB-CR

57
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.610
to SCRAM-SHA-1.

58
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.340
As a result of this,
MONGODB-CR is now

59
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.260
completely disabled
on this database.

60
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.250
It is impossible to
create users that use

61
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.460
MONGODB-CR on this database.
