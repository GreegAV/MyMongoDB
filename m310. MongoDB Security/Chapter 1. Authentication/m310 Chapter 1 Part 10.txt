Hi there.

Today I'm going to introduce you to LDAP authorization-- a feature introduced in 3.4 that enhances MongoDB overall integration with LDAP.

Prior versions to 3.4 already supported LDAP for authentication purposes.

This meant that MongoDB could be configured to authenticate users using an external mechanism to MongoDB-- a separate service like LDAP.

Now we can also configure MongoDB to integrate with LDAP at authorization level.

Before, we could validate with LDAP who the user claimed to be.

Now we can use LDAP to determine what the user is allowed to do within MongoDB.

Enabling LDAP for authorization will allow authentication via any of the existing external authentication mechanisms that MongoDB already supports.

This means that we can set up MongoDB to use LDAP authorization.

But we can use an alternate authentication mechanism-- like Kerberos or x509 certificates-- apart from the obvious LDAP for both authentication and authorization.

With MongoDB 3.4, we also remove the dependency on SASL proxy for authentication with LDAP-- except when users use PAM mechanism.

For integration with popular single sign on solutions like Centerfire and Quest.

In these cases, we still need to use SASL proxy.

Now let's have a look into the LDAP authorization mechanism steps.
