00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.090


2
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.860
Let's talk about
LDAP authentication

3
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.710
with the Enterprise
version of MongoDB.

4
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.500
LDAP, the Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol,

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.770
is a direct use service protocol
commonly used within companies.

6
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.560
With LDAP
authentication support,

7
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.400
users can authenticate
to MongoDB

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.070
using their LDAP credentials.

9
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.460
MongoDB communicates to an LDAP
server via the saslauthd proxy

10
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.360
service.

11
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.640
We'll configure
saslauthd such that it

12
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.110
can connect to our LDAP server.

13
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.320
And that way we'll connect our
mongod to the sasl via Unix

14
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.460
socket.

15
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.400
It's important to note that
MongoDB uses the sasl plane

16
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.620
mechanism for communicating
with the clients,

17
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.110
thus sending and receiving
data over plain text.

18
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.665
You can configure how
saslauthd communicates

19
00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:43.350
to the LDAP server, but
by default this will also

20
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.670
communicate via plain text.

21
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.190
This means it's in
our best interest

22
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.280
to run this set up on a trusted
channel such as a connection

23
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.880
that's encrypted with TLS or
over our trusted wired network.

24
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.380
I'm going to assume
you already have

25
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.900
MongoDB Enterprise
installed and have an LDAP

26
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.520
server up and running.

27
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.580
I'd like to point out that
my LDAP server in mongod

28
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.760
will be running on the same
machine for this demonstration.

29
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.250
I'm currently SSH'd
into an Ubuntu machine,

30
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.020
so keep in mind that
some of my commands

31
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.978
will be slightly different
from yours depending

32
00:01:11.978 --> 00:01:13.320
on your flavor of Linux.

33
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.110
Let's go ahead and
install saslauthd.

34
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.490
Here I'm running apt-get.

35
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.520
And I'm installing
saslauth2-bin.

36
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.050
And we're going to say yes.

37
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.690
And this will install saslauthd.

38
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.260
Cool.

39
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.676
Now that that's
been installed, we

40
00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:29.570
can go ahead and configure
saslauthd to talk to LDAP.

41
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.140
Here I'm using vim to modify
my saslauthd configuration.

42
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.827
And I'm running vim under sudo.

43
00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:36.660
And that's because we're
modifying something

44
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.630
that's in the etc directory.

45
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.380
And from here, we need
to go ahead and say

46
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.570
that we want start to be yes.

47
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.300
And after that, we want to
change this mechanism from pam

48
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.465
to LDAP.

49
00:01:46.465 --> 00:01:46.965
Awesome.

50
00:01:46.965 --> 00:01:49.290
Now let's go out
and save this file.

51
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.900
Now that saslauthd is
configured to talk to LDAP,

52
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.549
we need to go ahead and specify
some specifics about our setup.

53
00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.090
Here I'm going to
go ahead and create

54
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.460
a file called saslauthd.config
underneath etc.

55
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.110
And I'm going to, again,
need to use sudo because it's

56
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.742
under the etc directory.

57
00:02:05.742 --> 00:02:07.950
So in here, we can go ahead
and configure some stuff.

58
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.800
So since my LDAP server is
loading on a local machine,

59
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.550
it's local host, answering
on the default port.

60
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.370
And my search space, I'm going
to specify it as mongodb.com.

61
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.230
And then for my
actual LDAP filter,

62
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.242
my users are going to
be filtered by UID.

63
00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:24.510
We can go ahead and save this.

64
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.610
And now we can go ahead and
start the saslauthd service.

65
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.090
And here's the command to do so.

66
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.220
And now the daemon's
been started.

67
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.150
Now that we have our
configuration all set up,

68
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.820
we can go ahead and do the
next thing, which is change

69
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.640
the permissions on this folder.

70
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.530
And I had to run
sudo, by the way,

71
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.890
because this is
another special folder.

72
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.640
And this folder is
special because there's

73
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.410
this file called mux.

74
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.487
And this mux is
actually a Unix socket.

75
00:02:48.487 --> 00:02:50.070
And this is the
socket that will allow

76
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.250
mongod to communicate
with saslauthd,

77
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.290
which will then forward
our messages over

78
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.910
to our LDAP server.

79
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.490
So we'll go ahead and run
chmod on this folder

80
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.530
so that mongod
can actually access this mux.

81
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.460
Awesome.

82
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.320
Now that we have
changed permissions,

83
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.810
we can go ahead and
verify that saslauthd

84
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.790
can communicate
with our LDAP server

85
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.190
by running testsaslauthd.

86
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.380
And here I'm going
to run saslauthd.

87
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.330
And on my LDAP server,
I have a user named

88
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.090
Kirby whose password is LDAP.

89
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.310
And then I'm
specifying that mux.

90
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.110
And we get, OK, success.

91
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.370
Awesome.

92
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.350
Now that we verified
that saslauthd

93
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.390
can talk to our LDAP
server, let's go ahead

94
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.890
and configure MongoDB to
talk to this saslauthd.

95
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.730
Now that we have
everything configured,

96
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.580
we can go ahead and get MongoDB
up and running with LDAP

97
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.100
authentication enabled.

98
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.720
Here's the command to do so.

99
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.997
We're going to go ahead
and enable authorization.

100
00:03:41.997 --> 00:03:43.830
We're going to go ahead
and set a parameter.

101
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.220
We can set the authentication
mechanism to plain.

102
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.900
Going to set saslauthdPath
to the mux we've been using.

103
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.800
And then, of course,
dpath, logpath, and fork.

104
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.640
Awesome.

105
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.350
Now that our server
is up and running,

106
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.970
go ahead and connect to it.

107
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.930
Now we should be able to run
show dbs, and get an error.

108
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.529
And we do, as expected.

109
00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:05.070
And now we can go ahead and take
advantage of the localhost

110
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.209
exception and create
our first user.

111
00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.000
Here I'm going to use
the external database

112
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.302
because LDAP is an external
authentication mechanism.

113
00:04:11.302 --> 00:04:13.760
And I'm going to create a user
called Kirby, because that's

114
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.300
the user we were using.

115
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.029
And he's going to be a
root on the admin database.

116
00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.980
Sweet.

117
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.279
User's been created.

118
00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.687
And now we can go ahead
and try and authenticate.

119
00:04:22.687 --> 00:04:24.270
I'm first going to
try with a password

120
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.710
that we know is incorrect.

121
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.600
We know that my
passwords LDAP, but I'm

122
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.400
going to use the password LDAP2.

123
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.004
And we get
authentication failed.

124
00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:33.420
And now I'm going
to run it again,

125
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.000
but with my correct
password being LDAP.

126
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.860
And we see that it
ran successfully.

127
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.730
Awesome.

128
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.560
We now have a MongoDB
Enterprise server

129
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.180
up and running with LDAP
authentication enabled.
