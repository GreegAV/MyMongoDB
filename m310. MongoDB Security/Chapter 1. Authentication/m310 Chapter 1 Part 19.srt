1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840


2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.730
We can also use
X.509 certificates

3
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.570
to authenticate the members of a
replica set or sharded cluster.

4
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.120
Like with client base
X.509 authentication,

5
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.590
it's required that we use a
version of MongoDB compiled

6
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.836
with support for TLS/SSL.

7
00:00:14.836 --> 00:00:16.460
For the purposes of
this demonstration,

8
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.560
I've already created my
own X.509 certificates

9
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.220
for the servers.

10
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.420
As you can see here, I have
my certificate authority

11
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.120
public key, a key
file for my client,

12
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.000
and then certificates for each
of the members of my replica

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.669
set.

14
00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.210
Let's go ahead and
start up a replica

15
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.712
set with X.509 internal
authentication enabled.

16
00:00:35.712 --> 00:00:37.420
The first thing we're
going to need to do

17
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.870
is create the folders
for our servers.

18
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.240
Like before, I'm using mkdir,
passing in the tack p option

19
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.990
with replica set 1, 2, and
3, each with a subfolder

20
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.610
called db.

21
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.320
We can now go ahead and start
up the first member of a replica

22
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.310
set.

23
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.280
Here is the command to start
the first member of our replica

24
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.210
set.

25
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.030
You can see that I'm saying
mongod, specifying the replica

26
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.770
set called myReplSet.

27
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.990
Of course, dbpath, logpath,
and the default port of 27017,

28
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.420
fork.

29
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.620
I'm going to require
ssl since we're

30
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.760
using X.509 authentication.

31
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.830
I'm going to specify
X.509 authentication

32
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.790
as the authorization mode.

33
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.440
And then I'm going to pass
in the first certificate

34
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.440
for this member.

35
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.100
And then our ca file.

36
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.010
Our first member
is up and running.

37
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.320
We can now go ahead and
start the second member.

38
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.050
Here's the command
for the second member.

39
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.674
It's the same as the
last, except we've

40
00:01:32.674 --> 00:01:36.290
changed the dbpath,
logpath, port,

41
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.620
and of course member file.

42
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.120
Our second member
is up and running.

43
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.580
And now we can finally
start the third member.

44
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.740
Here's the third
member's command.

45
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.040
Same as before, except
changing dbpath, logpath, port,

46
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.980
and keyfile.

47
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.130
All three members are
now successfully started.

48
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.830
As you would expect, you can
now connect to these members

49
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.560
and initialise and add
each of the members

50
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.780
like we did in the
previous lesson.

51
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.620
So as you can see, the commands
to start each of our members

52
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.950
are getting kind of long.

53
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.660
It's a little bit hard to read.

54
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.660
Now is a great time to take
advantage of configuration

55
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.196
files to configure each of the
members of our replica set.

56
00:02:15.196 --> 00:02:17.570
I'm going to go ahead and show
you what one configuration

57
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.300
file would kind of look like.

58
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.300
The configuration file
looks pretty much exactly

59
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.990
as you expect.

60
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.390
We have a top level
security field

61
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.030
where we specify the
authorization mode.

62
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.530
We then have another
top level field

63
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.850
called net, which
has a subfield called

64
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.850
ssl, which has three
subfields called mode, CAFile,

65
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.910
and clusterfile.

66
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.010
Just like before.

67
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.760
We can now save this file
and start up our MongoDB

68
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.990
using the --config option,
passing in our configuration

69
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.090
file.

70
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.110
And you could use these
configuration files

71
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.200
again and again and again.

72
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.770
And it will save
you a lot of time.

73
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.520
And it'll actually
prevent you from making

74
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.250
a lot of simple mistakes.
