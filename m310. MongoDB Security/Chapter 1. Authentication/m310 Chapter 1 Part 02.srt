00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.450
Now that we actually understand
what authentication is,

3
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.060
we can talk about the different
authentication mechanisms that

4
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.270
are supported with MongoDB.

5
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.930
We can divide these different
authentication mechanisms

6
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.800
into two categories-- There's
client and user authentication,

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.650
which deals with how
clients of the database

8
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.000
authenticate MongoDB.

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.440
And then there's
internal authentication,

10
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.720
which is how different
members of a replica

11
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.500
set or sharded cluster
authenticate with one another.

12
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.020
Here are all of the different
authentication mechanisms

13
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.126
currently supported
with MongoDB.

14
00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:35.180
In the later video,
we'll go into each

15
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.140
of these with much more detail.

16
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.840
Of the five different mechanisms
that we currently support,

17
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.850
three of them are a part of the
Community version of MongoDB.

18
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.270
Whereas, these last
two, LDAP and Kerberos,

19
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.500
are only a part of the
Enterprise version.

20
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.490
Furthermore, SCRAM-SHA-1
and MONGODB-CR

21
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.000
are considered
challenge-response mechanisms.

22
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.420
Whereas, X.509 is
a certificate-based

23
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.010
authentication mechanism.

24
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.530
And LDAP and Kerberos are
both external mechanisms.
