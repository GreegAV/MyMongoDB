2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.190
Hi I'm Kirby and I'll be your
instructor for this course.

3
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.280
Security is a key aspect of any
mission critical application

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.320
and enterprise environment.

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.010
During this course we're going
to cover what security features

6
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.660
MongoDB has to offer,
and the best practices

7
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.110
associated with administering
a secure deployment.

8
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.000
This course is three weeks long.

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.220
Each week we'll release a
new lesson video, typically

10
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.430
accompanied by a quiz to assess
your learning of the material.

11
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.900
At the end of each
week there will

12
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.812
be a set of homework exercises.

13
00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:30.770
Let's go ahead and cover
a few of the logistics

14
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.210
of this course.

15
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.560
Target audience.

16
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.212
This is considered
an advanced course.

17
00:00:35.212 --> 00:00:37.670
It's expected that you already
have an understanding of how

18
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.810
to install and run MongoDB,
set up a replica set or sharded

19
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.360
cluster, and have a good
understanding of the MongoDB

20
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.210
query language.

21
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.780
How does grading work?

22
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.150
There are quizzes,
homeworks, and a final exam

23
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.730
as deliverables on your
part of the course.

24
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.560
Quizzes exist as a
formative measure

25
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.660
to make sure you
understand the content.

26
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.610
But your grade will be
based on how well you

27
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.460
do on the homeworks and on the
final exam, each of these being

28
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.280
worth 50% of your final grade.

29
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.740
I'd highly recommend you take
advantage of the discussion

30
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.730
forums.

31
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.860
We have very experienced
teaching assistants

32
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.842
who are there to help
answer your questions.

33
00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:13.550
And your fellow
classmates are also there

34
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.830
to help answer your
questions and are very often

35
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.680
helpful and
knowledgeable resources.

36
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.690
Based on our
experience, we've seen

37
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.910
that students who perform
best in the course

38
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.240
are those who take advantage
of the discussion forums.

39
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.360
As far as course
content is concerned,

40
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.800
we'll take a deep dive into
the different authentication

41
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.090
mechanisms that
MongoDB provides.

42
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.140
We'll talk about MongoDB's
different authorization models

43
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.110
and how to configure
it to your needs.

44
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.820
We'll then cover how
to configure and enable

45
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.589
encryption for your database.

46
00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:44.505
After that we'll discuss
auditing capabilities

47
00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:46.730
that MongoDb provides.

48
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.530
And finally, we'll
discuss some security

49
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.410
best practices that anyone
running a production system

50
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.940
should follow.

51
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.280
By the end of this course,
you should feel confident

52
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.310
that you can deploy a secure
MongoDB deployment where

53
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.560
you can configure the
role based authorization

54
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.850
model to your needs, set up
encryption, do proper auditing,

55
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.250
and follow security
best practices.

56
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.680
With all that being said,
we're super excited to have you

57
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.880
as a student in this course.

58
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.730
Best of luck.
