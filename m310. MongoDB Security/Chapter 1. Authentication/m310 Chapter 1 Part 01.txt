Before we get started talking about the different authentication mechanisms the MongoDB supports, I want to clarify a common point of confusion.

Authentication and authorization are commonly interchanged with one another, but they're actually two very different things.

Authentication is the process by which we verify the identity of a user, whereas authorization is the process by which we verify the privileges of a user.

The best way to think about it is that authentication answers the question, who are you?

Whereas authorization answers the question, what do you have access to?

I can be authenticated to a system, but I might not be authorized to control a certain resource.

Authentication enables us to do authorization.

Once we know who you are, we can then ask, what do you have access to?
