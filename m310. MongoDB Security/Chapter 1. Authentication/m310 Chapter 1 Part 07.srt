00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840


2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.830
By now, you should have a pretty
good, high-level understanding

3
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.750
of the different authentication
mechanisms and methods

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.660
that MongoDB supports.

5
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.890
We've also talked about some
important topics related

6
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.830
to authentication, like
the localhost exception,

7
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.940
internal authentication
mechanisms,

8
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.340
as well as how authentication
works on a sharded cluster.

9
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.180
In the next several
videos, we're

10
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.660
going to actually see how
to configure authentication

11
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.730
on MongoDB for each of
the different mechanisms

12
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.780
that we've explored
in prior videos.

13
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.597
In this first video,
I'm going to show you

14
00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:33.430
how to set up the most
common authentication

15
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.480
mechanism, SCRAM-SHA-1.

16
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.310
As you know, SCRAM-SHA-1
is the default mechanism

17
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.560
for password-based
authentication with MongoDB.

18
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.550
Let's go ahead and set
up a mongod instance

19
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.160
with SCRAM-SHA-1, and connect
our server with a mongo shell.

20
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.320
Since SCRAM-SHA-1 is the default
authentication mechanism,

21
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.150
it really is this easy.

22
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.160
We just pass the --auth option
to the mongod command line

23
00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.510
tool.

24
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.250
When I start running this,
our server is started.

25
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.110
I can then start a new shell.

26
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.190
I just type in mongo
to have the mongo shell

27
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.570
connect to our mongod instance.

28
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.940
This is a clean database.

29
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.160
So I'm going to go ahead and
switch to the admin database.

30
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.080
While on the admin database, I'm
going to run the db.createUser

31
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.090
command, specifying kirby as the
user, password as the password,

32
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.820
and I'm going to go ahead and
use his handy little helper

33
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.180
and just give myself
the role of root,

34
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.810
which gives me all privileges.

35
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.610
I run this.

36
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.200
It successfully added the user.

37
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.480
Now we can either use
db.auth, or close this shell

38
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.920
and start a new one, and
use command line arguments.

39
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.970
Let's go ahead
and do the former.

40
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.000
You can see, just as
we've done before,

41
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.420
I use db.auth, passing
in kirby and password,

42
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.510
and I'm successfully
authenticated.

43
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.940
Of course, if we want, we
can use a configuration

44
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.710
file to enable SCRAM-SHA-1
on a mongod instead

45
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.820
of passing in the information
via the command line options.

46
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.780
Configuration files for
MongoDB are in the YAML format,

47
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.950
and are passed to mongod
using the --config option.

48
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.290
Here we're going to create a
file called config using vim.

49
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.660
You can use any text
editor that you want.

50
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.660
As you can see, in
this config file,

51
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.320
we have this high-level
security key,

52
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.670
followed by this
authorization key

53
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.900
where I've set
authorization to be enabled.

54
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.140
We can then save this file.

55
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.650
And we can now run mongod with
our new configuration file.

56
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.720
We can confirm the
authentication is enabled

57
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.350
by connecting to the
server via the mongo shell,

58
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.880
and running show dbs
without any authentication.

59
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.330
As you can see, the server is
using our configuration file,

60
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.380
enabling authentication,
and preventing us

61
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.730
from executing the
show dbs command.

62
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.490
This command successfully failed
because our configuration file

63
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.590
has successfully enabled
SCRAM-SHA-1 authentication.
