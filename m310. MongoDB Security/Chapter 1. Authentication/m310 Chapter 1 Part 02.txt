Now that we actually understand what authentication is, we can talk about the different authentication mechanisms that are supported with MongoDB.

We can divide these different authentication mechanisms into two categories-- There's client and user authentication, which deals with how clients of the database authenticate MongoDB.

And then there's internal authentication, which is how different members of a replica set or sharded cluster authenticate with one another.

Here are all of the different authentication mechanisms currently supported with MongoDB.

In the later video, we'll go into each of these with much more detail.

Of the five different mechanisms that we currently support, three of them are a part of the Community version of MongoDB.

Whereas, these last two, LDAP and Kerberos, are only a part of the Enterprise version.

Furthermore, SCRAM-SHA-1 and MONGODB-CR are considered challenge-response mechanisms.

Whereas, X.509 is a certificate-based authentication mechanism.

And LDAP and Kerberos are both external mechanisms.
