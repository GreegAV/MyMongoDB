00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.310


2
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.850
Now that we
understand what roles

3
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.260
are and know what built-in
roles come with MongoDB,

4
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.310
we can now talk about
user-defined roles.

5
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.930
The built-in roles
that come with MongoDB

6
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.320
should cover the majority of
the different types of people

7
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.820
who need to use our database.

8
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.580
That said, sometimes we
have specific requirements

9
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.680
that do not exactly
fit a particular user.

10
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.790
Let's talk about the
different parts that

11
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.610
make up a user-defined role.

12
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.380
When we create a
role, we create it

13
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.260
on a specific database, so
the role name and the database

14
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.810
that it was created on
define a unique role.

15
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.070
After giving the role
a name, we specify

16
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.240
what other roles we'd like
to inherit privileges from.

17
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.940
It's important to note that
for any given role created

18
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.550
on a specific database, we
can only include resources

19
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.750
and inherit roles defined
on the same database.

20
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.560
For example, if we define a
role on the Products database,

21
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.870
we can't inherit that role
on the Orders database.

22
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.410
If we would like to
share user-defined roles

23
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.760
across databases, then we
need to define a global role.

24
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.040
To define a global
role, roles that

25
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.480
have privileges on
several databases,

26
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.800
we need to create such
roles on the admin database.

27
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.990
Cluster-wide
resources can also be

28
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.030
created on the admin
database and then inherited

29
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.460
by other databases.

30
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.550
Coming back to our definition
of a user-defined role,

31
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.850
recall that we create
a name for a role,

32
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.640
and we create the
role with regards

33
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.330
to a particular database,
and that will uniquely

34
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.110
identify the role.

35
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.100
After that, we add
any other roles

36
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.830
that we would like to
inherit privileges from.

37
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.860
And then finally, we list all
of the additional privileges

38
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.730
we'd like this role to have.

39
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.080
Recall that a privilege
is just an action

40
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.560
acting on a particular resource.

41
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.410
And this is the definition of
a user-defined role in MongoDB.

42
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.780
We'll walk through
an example of how

43
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.670
to create a user-defined role
in the shell in a later video.
