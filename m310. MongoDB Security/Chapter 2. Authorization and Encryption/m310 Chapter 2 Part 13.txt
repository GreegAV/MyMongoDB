Sometimes organizations have individuals, or processes that require specific roles to be created.

To accommodate these use cases, we know that MongoDB allows us to create user-defined roles.

We know from previous videos that roles are comprised of three components: a name, a list of inherited roles, and a list of privileged documents.

In order to create a new role, we pass these three elements to db.createrole as a document.

In the previous video, we saw how to use built in roles to create a set of generic users with their respective roles.

We're now going to look at how to create a custom role for one of our users.
