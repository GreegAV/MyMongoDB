Encryption plays an important part in any security infrastructure.

In this series of videos, we're going to discuss the different corruption options that MongoDB supports.

There are two discrete categories of encryption with regards to MongoDB.

Be There's Transfer Encryption, and then there's also Encryption at Rest.

Transfer Encryption, as the name implies, refers to encrypting information over network traffic between the client and the server.

Encryption at Rest concerns actually encrypting the data that we store on disk.

There are two broad classes of approaches to encrypting data at rest with MongoDB.

There's storage level encryption, and application level encryption.

We'll take a deep dive into each of these topics later in this course.
