1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.560


2
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.350
To correct this
situation, we need

3
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.870
to change Carol's role from
dbAdmin to dbAdminAnyDatabase.

4
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.280
Alice, our security
officer, should

5
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.700
be able to update Carol's
role by using the update user

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.860
command.

7
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.690
Here, I'm ging to run the
db.updateUser command.

8
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.250
We're going to
update it for Carol,

9
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.790
and we're going to change her
roles from wherever they were

10
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.980
before, which we
know is dbAdmin,

11
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.590
to just being dbAdminAnyDatabase
on the admin database.

12
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.400
We can now confirm this
by running db.getUser.

13
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.190
And now can easily confirm
that Carol does indeed

14
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.170
have the dbAdminDatabase role.

15
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.880
Now when we
authenticate with Carol,

16
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.780
we should be able run show dbs.

17
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.770
And we can.

18
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.670
Awesome.

19
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.980
Carol can now do her job.
