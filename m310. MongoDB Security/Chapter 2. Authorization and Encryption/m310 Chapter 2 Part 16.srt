1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.680


2
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.290
So let's say our
intern now needs

3
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.050
to log all of his operations
that he is running into one

4
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.800
specific collection, but
independent of the database

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.160
that collection is on.

6
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.220
Well, we can update his
role to do just that.

7
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.550
Here I'm going to run the
db.grantPrivilegesToRole

8
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.170
command where I'm gonna specify
that I want on the intern role

9
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.520
I want to add this
array of privileges.

10
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.000
In this case it's just
one privileged document

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.350
where I'm saying any database
that has the intern log

12
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.160
collection, I want this role
to be able to insert and update

13
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.450
on this collection.

14
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.970
And it looks like
it ran successfully.

15
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.780
And here I can go ahead
and run db.getRole.

16
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.950
And I can specify
the intern role.

17
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.360
And I say I want to
show all the privileges.

18
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.100
And as you can see,
here are the privileges

19
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.670
that we saw before--
the ability to update

20
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.430
the meteorites collection
on the NASA database.

21
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.630
We now also have
a new privilege,

22
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.860
which is the ability
to insert or update

23
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.750
a collection on any database.
