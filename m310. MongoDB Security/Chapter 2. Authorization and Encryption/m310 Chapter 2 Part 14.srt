1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.470
So let's assume that our intern
has proven to be very capable.

3
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.380
And we now want to give him
a bit more responsibility.

4
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.380
To do that, Alice,
our security officer,

5
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.050
will be able to create
a new user-defined role,

6
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.910
and then can change
the intern's role

7
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.850
to reflect this new
set of privileges.

8
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.820
In this particular case,
we want to allow our intern

9
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.400
to perform updates on
the meteorite collection

10
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.350
within the NASA database.

11
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.940
Here we have the
db.createRole command.

12
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.270
I'm creating a new
role called internRole.

13
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.520
And here's the list of
our privileged documents.

14
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.219
We just have one
privileged document,

15
00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:34.760
which is the privileged
document that

16
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.750
allows us to update the
collection meteorites

17
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.640
on the NASA database.

18
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.560
So here's our resource document.

19
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.510
Here's our list of
actions, in this case, just

20
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.160
the update action.

21
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.200
And then we still
want this intern role

22
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.960
to be able to
inherit the ability

23
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.020
to read the NASA database, just
like the intern was before.

24
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.030
So here is the read role
on the NASA database.

25
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.919
And here are all
the inherited roles.

26
00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:00.960
Now when we click Enter,
we can see that the role

27
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.600
has been successfully created.

28
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.430
To complete this
configuration, we just

29
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.480
need to update the intern user
and grant them the intern role.

30
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.680
Here we go.

31
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.970
I'm now going to update the user
intern with a list of roles.

32
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.160
So this will override any
roles they currently have.

33
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.390
And the only role that
we're going to give them

34
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.592
is the intern role on
the admin database.

35
00:01:19.592 --> 00:01:21.800
Here I'm going to go ahead
and get the NASA database,

36
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.070
because that's the database
that the intern was created on.

37
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.830
And now I can go ahead
and issue updateUser

38
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.110
on the NASA database,
specifying that I

39
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.540
want to update the
intern user, and replace

40
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.260
all their current
roles with this list

41
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.910
of roles, which in this case
is just our new role-- intern

42
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.160
role.

43
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.790
Let's go ahead and
authenticate as the intern,

44
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.280
and see if we can
update our meteorites.

45
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.820
Here we go.

46
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.530
I'm going to go ahead
and authenticate

47
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.900
as the intern on
the NASA database.

48
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.990
And now I can go ahead
and find a meteorite.

49
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.000
And here's a nice meteorite.

50
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.770
Now let's go ahead and try
and update this meteorite.

51
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.140
Now I'm going to
attempt to run update

52
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.060
on the meteorites collection.

53
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.340
I'm going to get the
same document right here

54
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.560
by using ID equals 2.

55
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.590
And then I'm going to
set a new field called

56
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.330
newfield with the string,
"the update worked!"

57
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.960
Awesome.

58
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.280
And as you can see,
here is our result.

59
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.410
And there's our
updated document.

60
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.024
Great.

61
00:02:16.024 --> 00:02:17.690
Now we can assign the
task of correcting

62
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.170
all the data to the intern.
