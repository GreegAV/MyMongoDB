00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.200
By now you should have a pretty
good understanding of user

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.120
authorization with MongoDB.

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.000
We're now ready to
take our new knowledge

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.180
and apply it with a
real world example.

6
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.650
For this demonstration,
we're going

7
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.160
to imagine that we
have a technology

8
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.660
organization with four
users of our database.

9
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.679
Each of these users will
have different rules

10
00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.470
according to the
different responsibilities

11
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.850
that they have.

12
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.340
So here's our
imaginary organization.

13
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.920
First, we have Alice.

14
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.630
She's a security officer.

15
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.100
Next, we have Ben.

16
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.380
He's the sysadmin.

17
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.280
Then we have Carol.

18
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.130
She's our DBA.

19
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.410
And finally, we have Dan.

20
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.430
Dan's an intern, and he does
most of the work on the team,

21
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.141
but he can only touch
one specific database.

22
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:45.640
We don't want him messing up
the configuration of the system

23
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.300
or anything.

24
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.920
So for all these
users, we should

25
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.450
be able to get by only using
the available built-in rules

26
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.870
with MongoDB.

27
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.100
Let's go ahead and start
by booting up a cluster

28
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.490
with authorization enabled.
