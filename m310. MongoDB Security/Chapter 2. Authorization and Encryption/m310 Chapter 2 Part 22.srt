1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.499


2
00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.290
While transport encryption
between client and server

3
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.880
is very important,
it's equally important

4
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.740
that the members
of our replica set

5
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.150
are also using TLS or
SSL to communicate.

6
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.610
Remember, a security
system is only

7
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.490
as strong as its weakest link.

8
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.770
Setting up TLS
within a replica set

9
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.984
is a relatively
straightforward process.

10
00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:23.400
At a high level,
we're essentially

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.640
doing the same thing as setting
it up with a standalone server,

12
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.860
but for each member
in a replica set.

13
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.505
Let's go ahead and do this.

14
00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:32.130
Hopefully by now
you're starting to get

15
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.050
the feel of setting
up your replica

16
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.360
sets in different modes.

17
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.240
Here we're requiring SSL,
because the whole point

18
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.480
of this exercise
is to enable SSL

19
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.536
in between the members
of our replica set.

20
00:00:44.536 --> 00:00:46.160
And then of course,
we're going to have

21
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.380
to pass in our
servers certificate,

22
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.290
our ca certificate so that
we can identify and verify

23
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.270
that everyone is who
they say they are,

24
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.130
we'll give our
replica set a name,

25
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.380
in this case myEncryptedReplSet,
specify the db path, the log

26
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.730
path, the port, and
we'll fork this process.

27
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.660
Awesome.

28
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.780
Now we just need to do this two
more times for the other two

29
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.820
members in our replica set.

30
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.650
And as we've done
many times before,

31
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.150
the only thing I changed here
is the db path, log path,

32
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.300
and port number, leaving all
the other parameters the same.

33
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.960
And here we go.

34
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.620
Here is the last command, only
changing the db path, log path,

35
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.060
and port number again.

36
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.870
Awesome.

37
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.006
Now all four of our
MongoDBs are up and running.

38
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:35.130
Now that we have each of
the members of our replica

39
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.350
set up and running,
we can go ahead

40
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.650
and connect to the first
server, initialize the ReplSet,

41
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.670
and add the other members.

42
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.280
So here we're going
to need to use

43
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.980
--ssl option saying that we're
going to connect via SSL.

44
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.640
And of course, we'll then
need to provide our client SSL

45
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.904
certificate and our
ca's certificate

46
00:01:57.904 --> 00:02:00.070
so that we know the server
is who they say they are.

47
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.920
We're now connected
and we can go ahead

48
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.310
and initialized the ReplSet
and add the other members

49
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.930
of our replica set.

50
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.690
We can go ahead now and
initiate our ReplSet.

51
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.320
Here I'm passing in the
configuration for our ReplSet

52
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.960
specifying the
name of the replica

53
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.180
set, the version, and an
array of all the members.

54
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.890
Each member is an object that
has its ID and respective host

55
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.710
name.

56
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.522
And it's as simple as that.

57
00:02:25.522 --> 00:02:27.480
Now there's something I
want to point out here.

58
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.810
I used localhost instead
of the actual hostname

59
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.220
on my machine,
which is something

60
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.840
that I don't normally do.

61
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.620
And the reason I did that
is because my certificate,

62
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.600
my server certificate,
if we look in here

63
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.430
we have this
server.pem key file.

64
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.880
If we go ahead and look at the
contents of this key file using

65
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.610
the open SSL command,
specifying x509

66
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.100
since this is an
x509 certificate,

67
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.890
and then provide it as an end
in parameter, and just go ahead

68
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.810
and get out the text.

69
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.810
We have the public
key in here and stuff,

70
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.850
but there's a really
important field,

71
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.910
which is the subject
alternative name.

72
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.350
And here, I have two alternative
names, one is localhost

73
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.710
and the other is 127.0.0.1 which
is also localhost obviously.

74
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.760
And I have to use one
of these two names.

75
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.000
Whatever names are under
the alternative name,

76
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.160
those are the
hostnames that you have

77
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.640
to use to initialize the
members of your replica set.

78
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.520
If I try to use education
dash iMac, which

79
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.690
is the name of this machine, and
passed in the port of 27 0 17

80
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.050
I would actually get a
SSL handshake failure.

81
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.050
So that's just one little common
gotcha I wanted to make clear.

82
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.150
If you run into this
you want to make sure

83
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.210
that you check the alternate
names in your actual server key

84
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.760
files.
