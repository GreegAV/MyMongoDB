1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.499


2
00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.110
When using TLS there are
several connection modes

3
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.460
that can be passed to MongoD.

4
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.880
Here's an example command
to start a MongoDB server.

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.550
We've seen commands like
this before when setting up

6
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.700
x.509 authentication.

7
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.690
Here we're saying MongoDB
passing in the dash dash SSL

8
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.420
mode option, which takes
the argument of what

9
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.750
kind of connection mode
we're going to have.

10
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.740
In this case-- and as
we've seen before-- we're

11
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.520
using requireSSL.

12
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.860
And then of course, since
we're requiring SSL,

13
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.290
we need to pass in the KeyFile
for this SSL connection.

14
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.490
There actually exists
four different SSL modes

15
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.890
when using SSL with MongoDB.

16
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.950
There is disabled, where the
server does not use TLS at all.

17
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.950
And this is the
default mode when you

18
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.760
don't pass an option to MongoD.

19
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.090
There's allowSSL, which
means that connections

20
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.010
between the server do
not have to use TLS.

21
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.870
But if there is an incoming
connection that uses TLS,

22
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.010
the server will then accept it.

23
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.800
There is preferredSSL,
which means connections

24
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.120
in between members
of a replica set

25
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.524
or sharded cluster will use TLS.

26
00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:08.190
But for incoming
connections, the server

27
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.360
will accept both TLS connections
and non-TLS connections.

28
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.250
And then there's
requireSSL, which

29
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.960
means that all
connections to the server,

30
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.110
whether between members of a
replica set or sharded cluster,

31
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.220
or between the
server and client,

32
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.690
all connections will
be required to use SSL.
