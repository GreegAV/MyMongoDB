2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.940
In this video,
we're going to talk

3
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.900
about the authorization model
that is used with MongoDB.

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.730
MongoDB actually follows a
very straightforward and common

5
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.210
authorization model,
and that model

6
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.260
is role based access control.

7
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.720
Role based access control,
as the name implies,

8
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.880
is a model where
for any given user

9
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.090
we're going to go ahead and
assign a role to that user.

10
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.420
And that role is going to be
assigned over a given name

11
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.060
space.

12
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.020
And in the context of MongoDB,
a namespace is just a database.

13
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.800
So for example, here we
have a user named Kirby,

14
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.590
and Kirby has the
readWrite roll,

15
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.264
which has been granted to him
for the products database.

16
00:00:47.264 --> 00:00:49.680
And this makes a lot of sense
given the command that we've

17
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.280
been using to create users.

18
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.070
As you can see
here, this is really

19
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.380
just a one to one relationship.

20
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.400
We have a user named Kirby, a
roll called the readWrite role,

21
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.319
and the readWrite role is
for the products database.

22
00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.670
Now that we have a general
idea of what role based

23
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.070
access control is, let's
go ahead and break down

24
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.540
what a role is.

25
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.430
The formal definition
of a role with regards

26
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.030
to role based access
control is the following.

27
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.710
Roles are groups of privileges,
actions over resources,

28
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.280
that are granted to users
over a given namespace,

29
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.620
commonly referred
to as a database.

30
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.380
So we know what users
are and we obviously

31
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.530
know what databases are, but
what are privileges, actions,

32
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.210
and resources?

33
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.130
Well, let's go ahead and take
a closer look at these three

34
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.770
things and how they relate
together to define roles.

35
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.480
Let's first talk about actions.

36
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.640
All operations and commands that
a user can perform in MongoDB

37
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.670
are called actions.

38
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.530
And actions are performed
on the resources.

39
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.560
Resources are any objects that
hold state in our database.

40
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.220
So for example, a
collection, a database,

41
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.960
or a database cluster.

42
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.560
And when a user performs an
action on a given resource

43
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.820
that constitutes a privilege.

44
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.890
And if we then go
ahead and group

45
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.270
a bunch of these
privileges together,

46
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.800
we can go ahead and rename
that group of privileges

47
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.220
just a role.

48
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.630
This sentence should make
a lot more sense now.

49
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.750
I'm going to go ahead
and say it again.

50
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.590
Roles are groups or privileges,
actions over resources,

51
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.160
that are granted to users
over a given database.

52
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.920
We've now looked at all of the
different parts that make up

53
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.597
this definition of a role.

54
00:02:47.597 --> 00:02:49.680
And so you should have a
much better understanding

55
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.250
of what roles are in
the context of MongoDB.
