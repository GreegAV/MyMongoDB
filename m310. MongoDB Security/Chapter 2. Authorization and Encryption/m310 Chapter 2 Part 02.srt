1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.499


2
00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.070
Now that we know what roles
are, let's talk about some

3
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.780
of the built in roles that
come prepackaged with MongoDB.

4
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.000
MongoDB comes with a set of
general purpose built in roles.

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.450
Roles that we know
from experience

6
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.120
are generally required
by different individuals

7
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.810
and therefore different
responsibilities

8
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.270
within an organization.

9
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.010
These roles can be divided
into the following categories.

10
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.350
First we have
database user roles.

11
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.040
There are only
two roles in here,

12
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.570
but these are two of the
most commonly used roles.

13
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.990
First we have the read role,
which grants the following

14
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.950
privileges.

15
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.036
And these privileges make sense
based on the name of the role.

16
00:00:35.036 --> 00:00:37.660
We would expect that if we were
granted the read role that we'd

17
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.290
be able to run find, dbHash,
listIndexes, listCollections,

18
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.470
et cetera.

19
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.620
Next we have the readWrite role.

20
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.950
This role grants us all the
privileges of the read role,

21
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.100
in addition to the
following privileges.

22
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.100
Now this demonstrates
a powerful feature

23
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.830
of the role based access
control authorization

24
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.270
system that MongoDB brings.

25
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.070
Role inheritance.

26
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.050
We have the ability to inherit
the privileges of other roles

27
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.900
for a given role.

28
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.340
We'll talk more
about this later,

29
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.089
but I wanted to bring
it to your attention

30
00:01:12.089 --> 00:01:14.940
while we discuss all these
different built-in roles.

31
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.430
After database user
roles we can next

32
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.197
talk about database admin roles.

33
00:01:19.197 --> 00:01:20.780
The first role I'm
going to talk about

34
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.700
is the dbAdmin role, a role
that grants us these following

35
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.840
privileges.

36
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.110
And again, this makes sense.

37
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.490
Imagine if we had a
database administrator,

38
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.280
they'd need to be able to create
collections for developers,

39
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.960
create indexes for
developers, maybe go

40
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.360
through old parts
of the database

41
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.270
by dropping some
old collections,

42
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.460
or dropping that
old test database

43
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.170
that the developers were using.

44
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.280
All of these
privileges make sense

45
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.640
for a database administrator.

46
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.440
The userAdmin role is
exactly what it sounds like,

47
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.530
is the ability to administrate
users within our database.

48
00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.480
Things like changing a user's
password, creating a new user,

49
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.560
creating a new role,
granting a role to a user,

50
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.490
dropping a role, viewing
a user, et cetera.

51
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.990
Anything that involves
user management or user

52
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.090
administration is going
to be the userAdmin role.

53
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.010
And finally, we have
the dbOwner role,

54
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.350
which inherits the privileges
of readWrite, dbAdmin,

55
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.350
and the userAdmin roles.

56
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.010
After the database
administration roles,

57
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.990
we can now talk about
the all database roles.

58
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.590
Now, these roles are
going to sound familiar,

59
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.380
and that's because they're the
same roles that we just talked

60
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.130
about, but with privileges
on different resources.

61
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.780
In this case, any database.

62
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.870
So for example, the
readAnyDatabase role

63
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.560
inherits the privileges
of the read role,

64
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.420
but for any database.

65
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.000
Similarly, the read
write, user admin, and db

66
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.430
admin roles all have the same
privileges as their first part

67
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.820
of their name, except
these roles now get

68
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.300
privileges for any database.

69
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.370
After the all
database category we

70
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.260
can move on to the
cluster admin category.

71
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.680
Now here, we expect
to find roles

72
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.250
that allow us to perform actions
across an entire cluster.

73
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.340
And by cluster I mean a replica
set or a sharded cluster.

74
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.110
And that's exactly what we find.

75
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.430
First we have the clusterManager
role, which gives us

76
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.850
the following privileges.

77
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.980
A Cluster Manager, it
would make sense for them

78
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.660
to be able to add shards,
cleanup orphans, list shards,

79
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.830
remove shards, set up replica
sets, or resync a member.

80
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.560
Next, we have the clusterMonitor
role, which gives us

81
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.960
the following privileges.

82
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.930
Here we're going to
see a lot of stat

83
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.180
reading privileges like
connection pool stats,

84
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.570
getting server parameters,
getting host info,

85
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.870
getting server
status, et cetera.

86
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.900
Now, the hostManager
role is very

87
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.150
similar to the
clusterManager role,

88
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.570
except you'll see that
we now have privileges

89
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.880
like the ability to
do things specifically

90
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.820
on a host like running
the CPU profiler,

91
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.410
or ordering a forced
sync, or killing

92
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.540
an operation on a member,
or resyncing a member,

93
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.190
or shutting down a member.

94
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.650
It's somewhat similar to
the clusterManager role

95
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.870
but with regards to
an individual host

96
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.300
or an individual member
within our cluster.

97
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.410
And finally, we have
the clusterAdmin role,

98
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.520
which inherits the privileges
of all three of the other roles.

99
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.420
After clusterAdmin roles,
we can talk about the backup

100
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.570
and restore roles.

101
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.820
This group is pretty
straightforward.

102
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.680
First, we have the backup
role, which as you would expect

103
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.220
allows us to do everything
that we need in order

104
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.280
to back up our database.

105
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.100
And similarly, we
have the restore role,

106
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.880
which allows us to do
everything we need to restore

107
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.110
our database from a backup.

108
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.410
Moving on, we can talk about
two special categories.

109
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.710
First, we're going to talk
about the superuser category.

110
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.600
Now these first
three roles, you've

111
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.040
already seen these before.

112
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.960
But we're bringing them up again
because we consider these roles

113
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.330
to be superuser rules.

114
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.210
And that's because
these roles allow

115
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.850
a user to assign themselves
any role that they want.

116
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.670
So for example, when
the dbOwner role

117
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.470
is assigned to the
admin database,

118
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.150
a user can then assign
themselves any role

119
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.990
they want on any database.

120
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.020
Similarly, the userAdmin
role allows us to do this.

121
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.240
Actually, the dbOwner
role can do this

122
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.000
because it inherits
the userAdmin role.

123
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.630
And then similarly, the
userAdminAnyDatabase role

124
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.626
would include the userAdmin role
on the admin database, which

125
00:05:33.626 --> 00:05:35.250
would then allow us
to assign ourselves

126
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.190
a role on any database.

127
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.430
And finally, we can
talk about root role.

128
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.970
And now, you've seen me use this
role before in other videos.

129
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.940
And while I might use it
a lot for convenience,

130
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.020
please be very careful
when assigning this role

131
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.352
to an individual.

132
00:05:50.352 --> 00:05:52.060
And that's because
the root role inherits

133
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.450
all of these privileges,
the readWriteAnyDatabase,

134
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.120
dbAdminAnyDatabase,
userAdminAnyDatabase,

135
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.670
the clusterAdmin role,
and the restore role.

136
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.230
All of these roles and all
the privileges associated

137
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.020
with all these roles are
all inherited by this one

138
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.020
role, the root role.

139
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.690
So needless to
say, the root role

140
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.960
can pretty much do
anything it wants.

141
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.440
So the super user
category was the first

142
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.540
of two special categories.

143
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.110
The second being the
internal category.

144
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.480
And the internal category
only has one role,

145
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.970
and that is the underscore
underscore system role.

146
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.720
And the underscore
underscores system

147
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.520
allows you to take any
action on any resource.

148
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.920
So this is a very,
very internal role

149
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.180
that is only used
by the server itself

150
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.710
for very special
internal operations.

151
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.560
And because of this,
you should never

152
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.650
ever grant this role to a user.

153
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.960
You might see this in like logs
or somewhere in the database,

154
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.520
and so I wanted to bring it up
so you know what was going on,

155
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.270
but I also wanted to
give you this warning

156
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.290
and tell you that you
should not use this role

157
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.290
or assign this role
to any of your users

158
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.100
unless you really,
really, really have to.

159
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.110
And those are the built-in
roles that come with MongoDB.
