1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.050
The next user we need
to create is Ben.

3
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.750
He's our sysAdmin.

4
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.000
It's Ben's job to manage
clusters and machines.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.990
This means he's going to need
to be able to do maintenance

6
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.000
operations-- things like
adding and removing members

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.480
of a replica set or
adding and removing

8
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.040
shards in a sharded cluster.

9
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.810
Ben should not,
however, be allowed

10
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.290
to see any collection
data, create or drop

11
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.880
any database or
collection, or even list

12
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.900
any collections or databases.

13
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.450
So now it's up to Alice, our
recently created security

14
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.180
officer, to actually
create such a user.

15
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.310
We'll first need to log in
with Alice's credentials.

16
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.880
We created Alice's account
on the admin database.

17
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.050
So we need to switch
that database first.

18
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.560
Now we can log in with
Alice's credentials.

19
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.440
And now we're
successfully logged in.

20
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.390
Before creating this user
and granting it a role,

21
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.320
let's go ahead and
check which roles

22
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.210
we think Ben will allow him
to do everything he needs.

23
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.630
I haven't mentioned this yet.

24
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.240
But it's important that you use
the online documentation that

25
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.140
docs.MongoDB.com to look at
all available built-in roles.

26
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.519
It very clearly
outlines here everything

27
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.520
that all the different
roles can do.

28
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.220
And since we want Ben to
be able to add and remove

29
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.120
shards or different
members of a replica set,

30
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.190
it probably makes sense to
use the Cluster Manager role.

31
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.700
This means he'll be able to
add shards, remove shards, be

32
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.744
able to do regular
replica set operations.

33
00:01:21.744 --> 00:01:23.910
But he won't be able to
look at any collection data,

34
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.670
or even list any
databases or collections.

35
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.320
Great.

36
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.740
Let's go ahead and
create this user for Ben.

37
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.530
Here I'm going to give
Ben the username ben.

38
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.840
His password, of course,
is going to be cables.

39
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.673
And we're gonna give
him the Cluster Manager

40
00:01:36.673 --> 00:01:38.770
role on the admin database.

41
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.690
Let's go ahead and
see if we can log in.

42
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.474
Great.

43
00:01:41.474 --> 00:01:43.640
Now Ben should be able to
configure our replica sets

44
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.010
and perform cluster maintenance.
