When using TLS there are several connection modes that can be passed to MongoD.

Here's an example command to start a MongoDB server.

We've seen commands like this before when setting up x.509 authentication.

Here we're saying MongoDB passing in the dash dash SSL mode option, which takes the argument of what kind of connection mode we're going to have.

In this case-- and as we've seen before-- we're using requireSSL.

And then of course, since we're requiring SSL, we need to pass in the KeyFile for this SSL connection.

There actually exists four different SSL modes when using SSL with MongoDB.

There is disabled, where the server does not use TLS at all.

And this is the default mode when you don't pass an option to MongoD.

There's allowSSL, which means that connections between the server do not have to use TLS.

But if there is an incoming connection that uses TLS, the server will then accept it.

There is preferredSSL, which means connections in between members of a replica set or sharded cluster will use TLS.

But for incoming connections, the server will accept both TLS connections and non-TLS connections.

And then there's requireSSL, which means that all connections to the server, whether between members of a replica set or sharded cluster, or between the server and client, all connections will be required to use SSL.
