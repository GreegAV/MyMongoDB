2
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.270
Sometimes organizations
have individuals,

3
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.770
or processes that require
specific roles to be created.

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.660
To accommodate
these use cases, we

5
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.130
know that MongoDB allows us
to create user-defined roles.

6
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.350
We know from previous
videos that roles

7
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.350
are comprised of
three components:

8
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.560
a name, a list of
inherited roles,

9
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.250
and a list of
privileged documents.

10
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.020
In order to create
a new role, we

11
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.800
pass these three elements to
db.createrole as a document.

12
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.790
In the previous
video, we saw how

13
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.210
to use built in roles to
create a set of generic users

14
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.259
with their respective roles.

15
00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:39.300
We're now going to look
at how to create a custom

16
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.780
role for one of our users.
