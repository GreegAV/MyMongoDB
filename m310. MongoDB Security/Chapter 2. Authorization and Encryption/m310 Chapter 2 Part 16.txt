So let's say our intern now needs to log all of his operations that he is running into one specific collection, but independent of the database that collection is on.

Well, we can update his role to do just that.

Here I'm going to run the db.grantPrivilegesToRole command where I'm gonna specify that I want on the intern role I want to add this array of privileges.

In this case it's just one privileged document where I'm saying any database that has the intern log collection, I want this role to be able to insert and update on this collection.

And it looks like it ran successfully.

And here I can go ahead and run db.getRole.

And I can specify the intern role.

And I say I want to show all the privileges.

And as you can see, here are the privileges that we saw before-- the ability to update the meteorites collection on the NASA database.

We now also have a new privilege, which is the ability to insert or update a collection on any database.
