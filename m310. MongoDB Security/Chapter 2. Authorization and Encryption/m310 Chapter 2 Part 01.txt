We can now discuss why MongoDB uses role based access control.

The best way to describe why MongoDB uses role based access control is to say that it gives us a high level of responsibility isolation for operational tasks.

And what I mean by this is that across our organization there are going to be a myriad of different people who are going to need access to our database.

But each of these individuals have very different needs.

We might have a DBA.

They're going to need the ability to create users.

We might have a developer.

They're obviously going to need to be able to insert data into our database.

But they're probably not going to need to be able to create users.

We might have a data scientist.

They're going to need to be able to read a bunch of data out of MongoDB.

But they're not likely going to need to be able to create users or insert data into our database.

What we're basically saying here is that within our organization there are a bunch of different roles.

And we can tightly define and tailor our roles in MongoDB to match the needs of our users.
