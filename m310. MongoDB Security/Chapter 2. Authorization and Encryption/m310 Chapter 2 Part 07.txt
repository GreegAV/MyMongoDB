By now you should have a pretty good understanding of user authorization with MongoDB.

We're now ready to take our new knowledge and apply it with a real world example.

For this demonstration, we're going to imagine that we have a technology organization with four users of our database.

Each of these users will have different rules according to the different responsibilities that they have.

So here's our imaginary organization.

First, we have Alice.

She's a security officer.

Next, we have Ben.

He's the sysadmin.

Then we have Carol.

She's our DBA.

And finally, we have Dan.

Dan's an intern, and he does most of the work on the team, but he can only touch one specific database.

We don't want him messing up the configuration of the system or anything.

So for all these users, we should be able to get by only using the available built-in rules with MongoDB.

Let's go ahead and start by booting up a cluster with authorization enabled.
