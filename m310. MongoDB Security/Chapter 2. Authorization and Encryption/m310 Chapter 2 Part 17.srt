1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
- So our intern
has gone too far,

3
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.840
and started to change
data that was logged long

4
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.950
before his time.

5
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.109
To solve this, we need
to go back and revoke

6
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.220
the privilege that allows
the update on the internlog

7
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.560
collection.

8
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.220
- To do this, we just need
to authenticate and run

9
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.620
the db.revokePrivelegesFromRole
command.

10
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.020
Here's the command that we use.

11
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.910
On the intern role, we want
to revoke this right here,

12
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.710
the ability to update
on the internlog

13
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.705
collection on any database.

14
00:00:28.705 --> 00:00:30.460
- It Looks like it
ran successfully.

15
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.084
Let's go ahead and
check out our roll.

16
00:00:32.084 --> 00:00:33.500
And here again,
we're going to use

17
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.170
db.getRole to show all the
privileges on the intern role.

18
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.800
- And now if we scroll up,
we can see on the internlog

19
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.100
collection, the user
is still able to insert

20
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.690
but is no longer allowed to
update on the internet log

21
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.500
collection on any database.
