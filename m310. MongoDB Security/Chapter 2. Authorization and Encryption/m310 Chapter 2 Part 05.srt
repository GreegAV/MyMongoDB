2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.700
In This video, we're going
to talk about resources.

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.960
We already know that
resources are the other half

4
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.360
of privileges in MongoDB.

5
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.110
They're the subjects
of our actions.

6
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.480
Resources will eventually have
their state or behavior changed

7
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.280
in some form by an action.

8
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.130
MongoDB has four resources,
collections, databases,

9
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.880
clusters, and the special
any resource resource.

10
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.326
All of these resources will be
defined by a resource document.

11
00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:35.700
Let's look at how to define
each of these with a resource

12
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.810
document.

13
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.930
First, we'll check out
collections and databases.

14
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.770
So here's the
generic template that

15
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.480
is used to define a
collection or a database.

16
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.180
Through this document,
we can actually

17
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.970
describe a few
different scenarios.

18
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.860
First, we can specify
a specific database.

19
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.120
In this case, the
products database.

20
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.670
It's important to note
that we always have both

21
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.950
the db and the collection keys.

22
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.710
If we want to specify
a specific database,

23
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.520
we must use an empty string as
a value for the collection key.

24
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.150
This resource document
would allow anyone

25
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.560
to perform the associated
action for this resource

26
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.840
on any collection within
the products database.

27
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.770
Conversely, if we want to
grant someone the ability

28
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.790
to perform an action on
a specific collection

29
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.150
across any database,
then we use this syntax,

30
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.780
here specifying the empty
string for the db field

31
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.090
and then specifying
an actual collection

32
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.110
name for a collection.

33
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.330
And of course, we can
specify a specific collection

34
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.520
for a specific database for
any action to be performed on.

35
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.710
Finally, if we'd like to give
someone access to perform

36
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.579
their action on any non-system
collection on all databases,

37
00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.120
then we can just
pass an empty string

38
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.700
to both the db field and
the collection field.

39
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.150
As far as the cluster
resource is concerned,

40
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.430
there's really just one document
and it looks just like this.

41
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.590
We just specify
the cluster field

42
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.190
to be true, simple as that.

43
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.770
And finally, we have the
any resource document,

44
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.470
which of course
allows an action to be

45
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.800
performed on any
resource in the database.

46
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.230
This is what it looks like.

47
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.680
We just pass in any
resource key, a true value,

48
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.580
and this is the resource
document for any resource.

49
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.150
Again, this resource is
for internal usage only.

50
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.610
Avoid its use at all cost.

51
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.250
And those are the different
resources in MongoDB.
