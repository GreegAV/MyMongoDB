00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.710


2
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.520
Encryption plays
an important part

3
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.930
in any security infrastructure.

4
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.792
In this series of
videos, we're going

5
00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:08.250
to discuss the
different corruption

6
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.890
options that MongoDB supports.

7
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.040
There are two discrete
categories of encryption

8
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.180
with regards to MongoDB.

9
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.120
Be There's Transfer
Encryption, and then there's

10
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.690
also Encryption at Rest.

11
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.360
Transfer Encryption,
as the name implies,

12
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.200
refers to encrypting
information over network traffic

13
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.556
between the client
and the server.

14
00:00:30.556 --> 00:00:33.180
Encryption at Rest concerns
actually encrypting the data

15
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.100
that we store on disk.

16
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.130
There are two broad classes of
approaches to encrypting data

17
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.950
at rest with MongoDB.

18
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.540
There's storage level
encryption, and application

19
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.800
level encryption.

20
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.420
We'll take a deep dive into
each of these topics later

21
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.200
in this course.
