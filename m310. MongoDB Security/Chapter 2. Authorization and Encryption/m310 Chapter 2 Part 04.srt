00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.660
In this video I'd like to
examine the different actions

3
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.510
that are supported in MongoDB.

4
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.560
We already know that there
are two parts to a privilege--

5
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.390
an action and a resource.

6
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.010
Actions describe the operations
that a given user may perform

7
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.410
on a resource in the database.

8
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.180
You can think of
actions as verbs.

9
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.680
While resources are the
subjects of these verbs.

10
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.350
Within MongoDB, we have several
different types of actions.

11
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.500
Let's go through each of
these categories one by one.

12
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.650
Let's start with query
and write actions.

13
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.730
All of the actions in this
category are related to CRUD.

14
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.810
You can see that we have things
like find, insert, remove,

15
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.660
update, and bypass
document validation.

16
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.000
Pretty straightforward.

17
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.990
After query and write actions,
we have database management

18
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.370
actions.

19
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.210
Most of these actions
are DDL operations.

20
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.270
These are structural
to the database.

21
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.470
Things like creating an
index, creating a collection,

22
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.580
dropping a user, killing
cursors, unlocking

23
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.080
the database.

24
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.190
One thing I want to
point out is that there's

25
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.670
a difference between
changing your own password

26
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.260
and changing a password.

27
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.150
The changeOwnPassword
role allows you

28
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.840
to change your own password.

29
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.370
Whereas the changePassword
role grants you the privilege

30
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.010
to change anyone's password.

31
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.300
After database
management actions,

32
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.800
we can move on to deployment
management actions.

33
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.640
Deployment Management
Actions are also

34
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.920
pretty straightforward.

35
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.387
They allow you to
manage your deployment.

36
00:01:31.387 --> 00:01:32.970
The one thing I like
to point out here

37
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.170
is that all of these
operations-- all

38
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.480
of these actions--
are only applied

39
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.450
to the cluster resource.

40
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.930
After deployment
management actions,

41
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.630
we have replication actions.

42
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.780
As you'd expect,
all these actions

43
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.020
involve getting and setting
different replications

44
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.360
settings.

45
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.130
We also have the
ability to append

46
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.410
an oplog note, do a resync.

47
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.140
All these actions
are also applied

48
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.810
to the cluster resource.

49
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.820
After replication we
can talk about sharding.

50
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.160
All of these sharding actions,
well, pertain to sharding.

51
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.280
Things like adding a
shard, enabling sharding,

52
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.900
listing the shards,
moving a chunk,

53
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.490
and removing a shard, et cetera.

54
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.170
Next we can take a look at
server administration actions.

55
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.010
All of these actions
relate to administering

56
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.620
the actual database--
things like running compact,

57
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.700
getting the host info,
getting a server parameter,

58
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.790
shutting the
database itself down.

59
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.770
All these are directly
related to the server

60
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.310
and administrating it.

61
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.950
Next we have diagnostic actions.

62
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.720
These are the actions often
required to diagnose or monitor

63
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.250
your database.

64
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.710
Generally, these are the
actions that will have access

65
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.070
to statistics and
metrics collected

66
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.810
by profiling or
similar resources--

67
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.450
things like connection pool
stats, db stats, index stats,

68
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.980
server status, et cetera.

69
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.610
And finally, we can talk
about internal actions.

70
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.280
These actions are the most
sensitive set of actions

71
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.180
that we can grant to a role.

72
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.140
Be very careful when
granting these actions.

73
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.790
They should only be granted
in exceptional circumstances,

74
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.617
as they are internal
to the database.

75
00:03:10.617 --> 00:03:12.450
And those are all the
different actions that

76
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.750
are supported with MongoDB.
