1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,380
Now let's look at operators
for array-valued fields.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,230
First, we'll look at $all.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:13,010
$all matches array fields
against an array of elements.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,113
In order for a document to
match a filter using $all,

6
00:00:17,113 --> 00:00:20,200
all the elements
we're looking for

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,790
must be included in
that array field.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,160
Now they don't necessarily
need to be in this order,

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,700
but each one of these must
occur in the genre's field

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,030
in this example.

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,480
So here, we're
filtering for documents

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,630
that have been classified as
falling into the comedy, crime,

13
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,710
and drama genres.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,570
Considering the
syntax for $all, note

15
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,460
that it's specified as
the value of the field

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,970
were searching on in our
filter, and that $all

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,270
has, as its value, an array.

18
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,714
And if we try this query
in the mongo Shell,

19
00:01:00,714 --> 00:01:02,880
we see that, in fact, each
one of the search results

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,570
does contain these three
genres in it genres field.

21
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,030
Note also that if we loosen
up our query a little bit,

22
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,750
and instead search for movies
that fall into the genres

23
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,970
comedy and drama, then we see
a mix of movies, all of which

24
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,010
have comedy and drama
listed among their genres,

25
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,040
but which also
list other genres,

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,140
whether it be romance,
adventure, thriller,

27
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,980
or something else.

28
00:01:29,980 --> 00:00:00,000
So that's $all.
