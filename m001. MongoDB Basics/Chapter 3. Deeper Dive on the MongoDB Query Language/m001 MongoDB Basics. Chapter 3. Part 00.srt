00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,860
In this chapter, we're
going to talk about

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,870
some more advanced MongoDB
query language concepts.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,560
The MongoDB query language
provides extensive support

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,000
for filtering documents
of all shapes and sizes,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,240
even those with
complex schemas

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,150
We'll look at the variety
of query operators available

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,550
and how to use them.

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,490
Note that because all four types
of CRUD operations-- create,

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,080
read, update, and delete--

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,560
require a filter,
our query operators

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,400
may be used in your filters
for any of the query language

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,320
methods we have discussed.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,120
You can find a complete
list, with links

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,170
to reference material
for all query operators,

15
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,201
in the MongoDB documentation.

16
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:43,450
We're going to do an overview
of each type of operator

17
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,190
with some very
concrete examples.

18
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,722
The best way to learn is
to get your hands dirty.

19
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:50,180
as part of this
chapter, we'll have

20
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,879
you do a number of
quizzes and labs

21
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:53,420
to give you quite
a bit of experience

22
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,810
with these operators.

23
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's get started.
