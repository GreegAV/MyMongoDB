1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,220
Now let's take a
look at dollar size.

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,770
We use dollar size to
match documents based

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,510
on the length of an array.

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,090
The countries field in the
movie details collection

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,190
stipulates the country in
which the movie was filmed.

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,650
In cases where the
movie was filmed

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,390
in more than one country,
you'll see multiple countries

9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,760
listed in the countries array.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,730
This query will
identify movies that

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,940
were filmed in just one country,
because for the country's array

12
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:34,670
field we're specifying a filter
such that we see in our search

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,430
results that have a size or
length of one for the countries

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,620
array.

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,620
And if we scroll
through our results,

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,490
we can see that in
fact just one country

17
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,510
is listed for each one
of these documents.

18
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,580
Contrasting these with
a number of other films

19
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,200
we've seen, if instead of
displaying the results we take

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,430
account, we can see that 1,915
documents in our movie details

21
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,420
collection have just
one country listed,

22
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,500
compared to the 2,295 documents
in the collection as a whole.

23
00:01:08,500 --> 00:00:00,000
And that is dollar size.
