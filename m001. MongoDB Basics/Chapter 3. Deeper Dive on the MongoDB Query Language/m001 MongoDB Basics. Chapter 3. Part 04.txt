Now let's look at operators for array-valued fields.

First, we'll look at $all.

$all matches array fields against an array of elements.

In order for a document to match a filter using $all, all the elements we're looking for must be included in that array field.

Now they don't necessarily need to be in this order, but each one of these must occur in the genre's field in this example.

So here, we're filtering for documents that have been classified as falling into the comedy, crime, and drama genres.

Considering the syntax for $all, note that it's specified as the value of the field were searching on in our filter, and that $all has, as its value, an array.

And if we try this query in the mongo Shell, we see that, in fact, each one of the search results does contain these three genres in it genres field.

Note also that if we loosen up our query a little bit, and instead search for movies that fall into the genres comedy and drama, then we see a mix of movies, all of which have comedy and drama listed among their genres, but which also list other genres, whether it be romance, adventure, thriller, or something else.

So that's $all.
