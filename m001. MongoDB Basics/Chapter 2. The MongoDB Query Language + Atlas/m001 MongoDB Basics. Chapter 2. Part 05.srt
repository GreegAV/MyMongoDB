1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,160
now that we've created a sandbox cluster
let's connect the Mongo shell to this

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,710
cluster now in case it's not 100% clear
to you from this point on we're going to

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:17,340
be using two different Atlas clusters
one is the class Atlas cluster that you

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,800
were using in Chapter one where we were
connecting from compass and exploring

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,510
datasets in this chapter as we explore
them on going to be query language we

6
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,340
will be using that same cluster from
time to time but we will also be using

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,989
the sandbox cluster that you've just
created in Atlas the sandbox cluster

8
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:46,590
because you have full administrative
access will allow you to issue rights to

9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,170
the datasets that are in this cluster or
more precisely to the datasets that we

10
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,140
will load into this cluster so at this
point please visit your sandbox cluster

11
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,879
in Atlas connecting to the sandbox
cluster is a pretty straightforward

12
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,710
operation
given what Atlas provides to us from the

13
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,619
Atlas view we simply need to click the
connect button and then scroll down to

14
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,820
the instructions for connecting with the
Mongo shell now it's pretty easy to be

15
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,060
confused about whether to use this
connection command or this connection

16
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,340
string for our purposes we will
completely ignore the URI connection

17
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,640
string here at the top of this modal do
not use this connection string to

18
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,770
connect to your Atlas sandbox cluster
instead scroll to the bottom of this

19
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,020
modal where we find a section connect
with the Mongo shell here you'll see

20
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:52,200
instructions for connecting via the
Mongo shell to this Atlas cluster we

21
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,240
have almost the entire command that
we'll need in order to do this now your

22
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,820
command will differ slightly because you
will have a different host name for each

23
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,878
of the nodes in your replica set for
your sandbox cluster so while these are

24
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,620
the host names for my Atlas cluster
yours will be different

25
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,420
however if you simply click copy here
and then jump into your command line

26
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,610
interface whether it's the terminal
application on a Mac or the command

27
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,769
shell on a Windows machine or some other
command-line interface on say a Linux

28
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:33,810
machine of some kind regardless of which
CLI you're using given that we've set up

29
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:39,329
our path this command should work for
you with one change you simply need to

30
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:48,420
change the password to m001-mongodb-basics. Now sometimes the captioning for

31
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,709
these videos doesn't reflect what we're
typing on the screen exactly so please

32
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:56,910
pay attention to what I'm actually
showing you here on the screen with this

33
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,909
command I can connect my Mongo shell to
my atlas cluster you can use a very

34
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:09,840
similar command that again you get from
the Atlas UI here to connect to your own

35
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,040
sandbox cluster the only difference for
you should be in what hosts are listed

36
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,540
here everything else should be the same
including the Mongo command and each of

37
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,700
the command line parameters that were
passing to Mongo again please make sure

38
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,540
you don't use this URI connection string
here but do use this Mongo command

39
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,419
provided for us in the connect with the
Mongo shell section of this modal now if

40
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:45,090
I run this command then I will see a few
different responses printed out as the

41
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,129
Mongo shell starts up but at the end
what we're looking for is a prompt that

42
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,750
looks something like this that indicates
we have connected to the primary I can

43
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,459
do exactly the same thing on Windows
copying the same command in and changing

44
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:07,769
the password to m001-mongodb-basics and see that I have successfully

45
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:13,379
connected to my Atlas sandbox cluster
and that is how we connect to our

46
00:04:13,379 --> 00:00:00,000
sandbox cluster from the Mongo shell
