1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,310
We've been working
with updateOne.

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,705
All of the same principles
apply to updateMany.

4
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:09,900
UpdateMany is our second update
operator in the MongoDB query

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,890
language.

6
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,290
The difference between
updateOne and updateMany

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,040
is that updateMany will
make the same modification

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,160
to all documents that
match the filter.

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,510
Let's take a look at an example.

10
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,420
I'd like to work
through a data cleaning

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,490
example for updateMany.

12
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,370
I happen to know that
in our movie details

13
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,180
data set there are some
fields in some documents that

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,770
are set to null.

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,050
What I'd like to do is
just eliminate null fields

16
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,850
from documents in
this collection.

17
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,710
We can see a few
of these documents

18
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,690
with this simple filter.

19
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,700
Here, we're just
pulling in all documents

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,600
that have null for the rated
field and null for the poster

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,380
field.

22
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,320
Note that there's 1,202
documents matching

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,610
these criteria.

24
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,060
If we just look for those
with rated equal to null,

25
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,690
we get quite a few more.

26
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,100
UpdateMany enables us
to modify many documents

27
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,700
at once, all of which
match the same criteria.

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,800
What I'd like to
do then is update

29
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,680
this collection
eliminating the rated field

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,480
where its value is null.

31
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,110
We'll do that using
this call to updateMany.

32
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,050
Here, we're using
the unset operator,

33
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,340
and the unset operator will
remove all fields listed here.

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,650
In this case, we've only
listed one field to remove

35
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,540
and that is rated.

36
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,810
Now, it doesn't really
matter what value we use here

37
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,040
as the value for the rated
key in the document we're

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,960
passing to our unset operator.

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,240
I just tend to use
an empty string.

40
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,560
From the results of
running this command,

41
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,450
we can see that we
modified 1,599 documents.

42
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,550
And if you'll remember,
that is the number

43
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,030
of documents for which
rated was set to null.

44
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,660
This wraps up our
discussion of updateMany.

45
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,910
The principles of filtering
and the use of update operators

46
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,270
are the same for updateMany
as they are for updateOne.

47
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,180
Again, I encourage you to
experiment, but be careful.

48
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,720
UpdateMany will modify all
documents matching the filter.

49
00:02:06,720 --> 00:00:00,000
Good luck.
