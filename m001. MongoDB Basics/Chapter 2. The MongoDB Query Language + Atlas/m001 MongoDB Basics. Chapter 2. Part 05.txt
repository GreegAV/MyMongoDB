now that we've created a sandbox cluster let's connect the Mongo shell to this cluster now in case it's not 100% clear to you from this point on we're going to be using two different Atlas clusters one is the class Atlas cluster that you were using in Chapter one where we were connecting from compass and exploring datasets in this chapter as we explore them on going to be query language we will be using that same cluster from time to time but we will also be using the sandbox cluster that you've just created in Atlas the sandbox cluster because you have full administrative access will allow you to issue rights to the datasets that are in this cluster or more precisely to the datasets that we will load into this cluster so at this point please visit your sandbox cluster in Atlas connecting to the sandbox cluster is a pretty straightforward operation given what Atlas provides to us from the Atlas view we simply need to click the connect button and then scroll down to the instructions for connecting with the Mongo shell now it's pretty easy to be confused about whether to use this connection command or this connection string for our purposes we will completely ignore the URI connection string here at the top of this modal do not use this connection string to connect to your Atlas sandbox cluster instead scroll to the bottom of this modal where we find a section connect with the Mongo shell here you'll see instructions for connecting via the Mongo shell to this Atlas cluster we have almost the entire command that we'll need in order to do this now your command will differ slightly because you will have a different host name for each of the nodes in your replica set for your sandbox cluster so while these are the host names for my Atlas cluster yours will be different however if you simply click copy here and then jump into your command line interface whether it's the terminal application on a Mac or the command shell on a Windows machine or some other command-line interface on say a Linux machine of some kind regardless of which CLI you're using given that we've set up our path this command should work for you with one change you simply need to change the password to m001-mongodb-basics.

Now sometimes the captioning for these videos doesn't reflect what we're typing on the screen exactly so please pay attention to what I'm actually showing you here on the screen with this command I can connect my Mongo shell to my atlas cluster you can use a very similar command that again you get from the Atlas UI here to connect to your own sandbox cluster the only difference for you should be in what hosts are listed here everything else should be the same including the Mongo command and each of the command line parameters that were passing to Mongo again please make sure you don't use this URI connection string here but do use this Mongo command provided for us in the connect with the Mongo shell section of this modal now if I run this command then I will see a few different responses printed out as the Mongo shell starts up but at the end what we're looking for is a prompt that looks something like this that indicates we have connected to the primary I can do exactly the same thing on Windows copying the same command in and changing the password to m001-mongodb-basics and see that I have successfully connected to my Atlas sandbox cluster and that is how we connect to our sandbox cluster from the Mongo shell
