1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,360
Now let's connect Compass to
your Atlas sandbox cluster.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,600
In order to do this, you'll
want to look at the cluster

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,180
view for your sandbox cluster.

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,300
And click through the
cluster name here.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,350
You might have named your
cluster something else,

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,590
but this is where you find
the name of your cluster.

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,910
Click through it.

9
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,180
And then what we're looking
for here is the primary.

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,130
Compass currently only allows
us to specify a single hostname

11
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,390
in the Form field.

12
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,730
It does a little
bit to help us out

13
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,820
if we have a connection URI.

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,380
For our purposes,
it's going to be

15
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,860
simplest to simply
identify the primary,

16
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,410
and then click through to it.

17
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,720
This is the hostname we want.

18
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,850
Your hostname will be
different because you

19
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,890
have your own sandbox cluster.

20
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,140
But for mine, this
is the hostname.

21
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,160
You can find yours in exactly
the same place in the Compass

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,450
UI.

23
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,360
Copy it.

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,430
Go back into Compass, and
paste it into the Hostname box.

25
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,340
The port is already
provided for us by default.

26
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,030
So at this point,
what we'll need to do

27
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,010
is simply specify the
username and password.

28
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,520
Now if you followed the
instructions for setting up

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,260
your sandbox cluster, to
create an administrative user

30
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,460
with the requested username
and password, then here

31
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,860
you should enter, for
username, m001-students,

32
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,230
and for password
m001-mongodb-basics.

33
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:34,670


34
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,770
The rest of the
defaults should be fine.

35
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,690
But you probably want
to create a favorite.

36
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,160
Then we can click Connect.

37
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,000
And here we see that as
we saw with show DBs,

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,770
we have three databases.

39
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,320
The one of interest
is the video database.

40
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,080
And in the video database,
you should see a movie details

41
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,040
collection with 2,295 documents.

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,620
We can click through
to that and look

43
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,470
at documents in the same
way we could and can

44
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,870
with the class Atlas cluster.

45
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,840
So that is how you
connect Compass

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:00:00,000
to your Atlas sandbox cluster.
