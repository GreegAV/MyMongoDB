1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,900
Three of the four
CRUD operations

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:08,210
are right operations,
create, update, and delete.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,610
All three of these
involve changing the data

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,010
in a collection in
one way or another.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,930
You only have read access
to our class Atlas cluster.

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,140
Fortunately, with the
Atlas free tier option

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,140
we have a means of creating
a sandbox MongoDB cluster

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,450
in minutes and at no cost.

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,560
The Atlas free tier is ideal
for proof of concept projects

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,170
and in the early stages
of developing a software

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,280
application.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,670
It's also great for testing
and for educational purposes.

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,070
Please follow along and create
your own Atlas free tier

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,180
cluster.

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,240
You'll be using this throughout
the rest of this chapter.

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,880
I've also included instructions
for creating your sandbox

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,590
cluster in the lab
that immediately

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,120
follows this lesson.

19
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,460
OK, here we need to complete
the registration form.

20
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,740
Once you've completed
the registration form,

21
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,240
go ahead and click continue.

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,000
Upon completing
the form, you'll be

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,600
asked to specify a group name.

24
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,020
Groups or how we manage
access to Atlas clusters.

25
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:21,080
I'm simply going to specify
shannon-m001 as my group name,

26
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,920
and create the group.

27
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,900
Once you've created a group,
go ahead and build a cluster.

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,340
You might get a notification
from the intercom integration

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,500
that we have here when you do
this, feel free to ignore it.

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,980
Also, don't be scared by what
you see when this first pops up

31
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,620
with respect to pricing.

32
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,080
Free tier is truly free.

33
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,780
We simply need to select
the M0 instance size,

34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,420
and you'll note that the
price has changed to zero.

35
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,780
Then we'll need to enter
a username and password.

36
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,740
Once you've entered your
username and password,

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,680
you can go ahead and
deploy your cluster.

38
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,560
Now again, the cluster is free.

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,000
No credit card is
required for any of this.

40
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,260
Please make sure you remember
the user name and password

41
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:09,940
that you entered.

42
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,340
You will need it later.

43
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,040
Now once you've
deployed your cluster,

44
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,420
you'll need to wait
just a minute or two

45
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,480
for the cluster to come up.

46
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,840
Once deployed, the cluster
is ready for connections.

47
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,340
But before we connect, we need
to change one security setting

48
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,260
to make it easy for us to access
the cluster from anywhere.

49
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,920
Click on the Security tab, and
then on the IP Whitelist tab.

50
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:38,220
Click Add IP Address, and
Allow Access From Anywhere.

51
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,860
It'll take just a moment to
update our security settings

52
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,280
in the cluster.

53
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,100
While that's happening,
let me stress

54
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,320
that making a cluster
accessible from anywhere

55
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,000
is not a best practice.

56
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,540
You should be as
restrictive as possible

57
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,600
with respect to IP
Whitelisting when

58
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,000
configuring an Atlas cluster.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,600
However, for purposes
of this class

60
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,380
this is fine, and will
save us wasted time

61
00:03:00,380 --> 00:00:00,000
debugging network issues.
