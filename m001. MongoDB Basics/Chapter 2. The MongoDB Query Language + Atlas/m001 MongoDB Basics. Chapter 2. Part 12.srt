00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,610
The find method
returns a cursor.

3
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,600
A cursor is essentially a
pointer to the current location

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,990
in a result set.

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,240
For queries that return more
than just a few documents,

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,250
MongoDB will return the results
in batches to our client.

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,340
And remember that the
mongo shell is a client.

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,480
We use the cursor in our client
to iterate through the results.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,340
In the shell, the
cursor is automatically

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,060
iterated up to 20 times to
print an initial set of search

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,600
results, as we see here
in response to this query.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,760
So when this query was issued,
the server returned a cursor

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,130
to the shell, and the shell
requested the next item

14
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,290
in the result set from
the cursor 20 times.

15
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,850
So what we'll see above here,
if we were to scroll up,

16
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,780
are the first 20
results from this query.

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,080
Now, as we iterate
through a cursor

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,030
and reached the end of a
batch of query results,

19
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,170
if there are more results,
iterating the cursor

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,320
will trigger a getMore
operation to retrieve

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,510
the next batch of results.

22
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,210
In this way, we can iterate
through an entire set

23
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,480
of search results.

24
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,020
Now, in this particular
case, the shell

25
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,870
provides a convenience, and
that is that after it displays

26
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,450
the first 20 results
we have an opportunity

27
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,660
to look at more of
them by typing it,

28
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,130
which is short for iterate.

29
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,600
And that will give us the next
20 results in our result set.

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,120
And we can continue to do this
until we exhaust the cursor.

31
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,440
So in this way, we can
iterate through an entire set

32
00:01:28,440 --> 00:00:00,000
of search results.
