1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,180
Now it's time to
dive in, and learn

3
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,550
the MongoDB query language.

4
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,290
Regardless of the
app you're building,

5
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,110
this is going to be important
as you work to get data

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,851
into and out of MongoDB.

7
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:15,350
We've already had a sample of
the query language in our work

8
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,570
with Compass so far.

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,150
In this chapter,
we'll do a deeper dive

10
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,460
so that you're fully prepared
to work with MongoDB data.

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,272
We'll cover CRUD operations.

12
00:00:26,272 --> 00:00:27,980
If you're not familiar
with that acronym,

13
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:34,600
it simply stands for create,
read, update, and delete.

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,680
It's these four
types of operations

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,610
that we'll be discussing
in this chapter.

16
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,200
In addition to MongoDB Compass,
we'll be using the mongo shell.

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,440
Like compass, the mongo
shell is a MongoDB client.

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,840
However, the mongo shell is
text based, rather than visual.

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,160
It also provides a number
of administrative functions

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,700
in addition to supporting
the MongoDB query language.

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,070
We'll be using the shell
throughout this chapter

22
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,349
because it provides full
support for the query language.

23
00:01:04,349 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's dive in.
