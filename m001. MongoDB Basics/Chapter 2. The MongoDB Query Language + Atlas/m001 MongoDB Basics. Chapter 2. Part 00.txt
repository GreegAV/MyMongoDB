Now it's time to dive in, and learn the MongoDB query language.

Regardless of the app you're building, this is going to be important as you work to get data into and out of MongoDB.

We've already had a sample of the query language in our work with Compass so far.

In this chapter, we'll do a deeper dive so that you're fully prepared to work with MongoDB data.

We'll cover CRUD operations.

If you're not familiar with that acronym, it simply stands for create, read, update, and delete.

It's these four types of operations that we'll be discussing in this chapter.

In addition to MongoDB Compass, we'll be using the mongo shell.

Like compass, the mongo shell is a MongoDB client.

However, the mongo shell is text based, rather than visual.

It also provides a number of administrative functions in addition to supporting the MongoDB query language.

We'll be using the shell throughout this chapter because it provides full support for the query language.

Let's dive in.
