The find method returns a cursor.

A cursor is essentially a pointer to the current location in a result set.

For queries that return more than just a few documents, MongoDB will return the results in batches to our client.

And remember that the mongo shell is a client.

We use the cursor in our client to iterate through the results.

In the shell, the cursor is automatically iterated up to 20 times to print an initial set of search results, as we see here in response to this query.

So when this query was issued, the server returned a cursor to the shell, and the shell requested the next item in the result set from the cursor 20 times.

So what we'll see above here, if we were to scroll up, are the first 20 results from this query.

Now, as we iterate through a cursor and reached the end of a batch of query results, if there are more results, iterating the cursor will trigger a getMore operation to retrieve the next batch of results.

In this way, we can iterate through an entire set of search results.

Now, in this particular case, the shell provides a convenience, and that is that after it displays the first 20 results we have an opportunity to look at more of them by typing it, which is short for iterate.

And that will give us the next 20 results in our result set.

And we can continue to do this until we exhaust the cursor.

So in this way, we can iterate through an entire set of search results.
