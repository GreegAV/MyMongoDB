1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,320
Let's connect to the Atlas
Cluster for this class, the one

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,400
that we've all been
using together.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,220
I'll show you how
to do that here,

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,670
but please see the lecture notes
for the exact connection string

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,880
and other parameters
you should pass to Mongo

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,490
in order to connect
to our Atlas Cluster.

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,570
We might need to change this
information from time to time

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,040
as we make updates.

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,480
The lecture notes
will be updated

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,270
as well so that you have
the necessary details

12
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,110
to connect to this cluster
from the Mongo Shell.

13
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,420
I'll paste those
details here, and then

14
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,887
let's talk about this
command a little bit.

15
00:00:36,887 --> 00:00:38,720
I want to point out a
couple of things here.

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,368
The first is that because
we're connecting to a cluster,

17
00:00:42,368 --> 00:00:44,410
we wanted to give the
Mongo Shell the name of all

18
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,090
the servers in this cluster.

19
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:52,050
Those are listed
here through here.

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,960
MongoDB is designed to provide
high availability access

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,053
to your data.

22
00:00:56,053 --> 00:00:57,720
It does this by
enabling you to maintain

23
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,140
redundant copies of your data in
a cluster called a replica set.

24
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,739
We configured our Atlas Cluster
to be a three-server replica

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,560
set in order to help ensure
you will always have access

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,500
to the data.

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,690
There are thousands of
students taking this class.

28
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,240
In the event that the
primary server goes

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,720
down due to a software
or hardware failure,

30
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,630
one of the other
servers will step in

31
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,120
to continue serving
data to clients.

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,760
If you'd like to know more
about how replica sets work,

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,830
please see the
MongoDB documentation.

34
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,110
One other thing I'd like to
point out about this command

35
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,360
is that at the very
end here, we can

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,080
see the word test immediately
following this slash.

37
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,540
That indicates that we're going
to connect to this cluster

38
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,435
and we're going to connect
it to a database called test.

39
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:47,810
Now if we would
prefer to connect

40
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,120
to a different database,
we can change this

41
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,500
to one of the databases we
know is available in our Atlas

42
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,300
Cluster.

43
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,460
Let's do the 100-year
weather database.

44
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,280
And if you'll
remember, that database

45
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,960
has a collection
in it called data

46
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,270
where all of the weather
readings are found.

47
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,118
Finally, the last thing I'd like
to point out about this command

48
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:12,160
is the fact that we're
making a secure connection

49
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,810
to this cluster.

50
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,760
As we did when
connecting with Compass,

51
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,420
we're using an encrypted
connection via SSL

52
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,730
and supplying the same
username and password

53
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,070
we did to connect with Compass.

54
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,620
So let's go ahead and
connect to our Atlas Cluster

55
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,130
with the Mongo Shell.

56
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,750
We'll see a prompt
that indicates

57
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,270
that we're connected to the
primary for this cluster.

58
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,630
The shell will always connect
to the primary for a cluster

59
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,190
as specified here, because it's
the primary to which most reads

60
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,790
are typically directed and to
which all writes for a MongoDB

61
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,950
cluster must be directed.

62
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,620
Only primaries in a
cluster can accept

63
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,450
writes and for
any cluster, there

64
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,690
is one and only one primary.

65
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,520
Now remember, we connected to
the 100-year weather database.

66
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,170
If we type show
collections, sure enough,

67
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,340
we see the data collection,
because we have connected

68
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,510
to this particular database.

69
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,120
If instead we'd prefer to
access the video collection,

70
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,070
we can use the use
command and use video.

71
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,530
And then, if we show
collections here,

72
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,310
we'll see our movies collection.

73
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,300
Now I'm going to show you
just one more command,

74
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,420
and that is just so we
can see the documents that

75
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,480
are in this movies collection.

76
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:34,980
OK?

77
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,320
And here, these should
look familiar to you

78
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,090
given that we've
already looked at a lot

79
00:03:40,090 --> 00:00:00,000
of this data in Compass.
