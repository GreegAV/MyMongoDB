1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,180
Compass doesn't yet fully
support the entire MongoDB

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,570
query language.

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,220
So in order to do some of
the lessons in this course,

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,250
we're going to need to
use the mongo shell.

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,290
The mongo shell is
a text-based client

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,490
that fully supports all
MongoDB CRUD operations.

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,300
In this lesson, I'm
going to walk you

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,390
through installing the mongo
shell on a Windows machine.

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,060
Here we have a Windows
10 environment.

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,240
I'll also show you some
of the subtle differences

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,300
you'll encounter when
installing on Windows 7.

13
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,120
There aren't many and you
should be fine on Windows 10

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,960
or on older versions of
Windows, provided they

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,250
are 64-bit versions of Windows.

16
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,410
Now to install the
mongo shell, we're

17
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,930
actually going to
install MongoDB itself.

18
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,450
We're going to install
the enterprise server.

19
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,030
The shell comes
packaged with the server

20
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,270
as part of the download from
the MongoDB Download Center.

21
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,760
So please navigate to
the Download Center.

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,890
And then instead of
Community Server,

23
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,760
let's click the
Enterprise Server tab,

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,519
and I will select Windows.

25
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,380
Now this is very important.

26
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,770
Even if you already
have MongoDB installed,

27
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,350
please go through these steps.

28
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,500
Earlier versions of
MongoDB in the shell

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,320
did not provide support
for SSL, and we're

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,810
going to need SSL support in
order to connect to our Atlas

31
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,920
cluster.

32
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,580
So select Windows 64
and then Download.

33
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,700
Now if you haven't previously
accessed the Download Center,

34
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,010
you'll be asked to
complete a download form.

35
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,970
Please just enter your details
there and then move through

36
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,430
to downloading the Windows MSI.

37
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,930
Now we're presented
with two options

38
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,330
here, either archive or MSI.

39
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,070
Please select MSI.

40
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,700
And again, it's Enterprise
Server, Windows 64, and then

41
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,450
MSI.

42
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,720
And we'll just wait
for that to download.

43
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,460
And once it does,
we can install.

44
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,740
And once the MSI downloads,
we can click it, and then

45
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,100
use the installation
wizard to install MongoDB.

46
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,639
Select Complete
and then Install.

47
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,070
Allow the app to make changes to
our device, and then we finish.

48
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,740
Now it's important that you
understand where MongoDB

49
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,030
was installed on your computer.

50
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,100
So if you click Windows
Explorer and then scroll down

51
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,956
to Local Disk, on your
machine the download location

52
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:30,580
should be something
like the following.

53
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:39,180
C:, Program Files,
MongoDB, Server, 3.4.

54
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,360
And then if we click
the 3.4 directory,

55
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,490
we'll see that there's
some license information,

56
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,910
but most importantly
is this bin directory.

57
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,910
The bin directory contains
all of the executables

58
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,910
that are distributed
with MongoDB server.

59
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,240
The one we're
interested in is mongo.

60
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,520
Now note that it's very
similar in name to mongo

61
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,110
d, which is the executable
for the MongoDB server.

62
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,490
For this course, we will be
using the mongo shell, which is

63
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,910
run from the mongo executable.

64
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,790
OK, before we can
run mongo, we're

65
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,610
going to need to
open a command shell.

66
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,030
Now regardless of whether
you're working on a Windows 10

67
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,150
machine or an older
version of Windows,

68
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,100
you have a text box
you can type in.

69
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,650
And if you type cmd, you'll
note that the command

70
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,720
prompt is suggested for us.

71
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,350
If we hit Enter,
then what pops up

72
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,770
is a command line
interface from which we

73
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,060
will execute the mongo shell.

74
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,700
Again, the mongo shell is
a text-based environment.

75
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,340
I can do something very
similar on Windows 7

76
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,670
by clicking the start button and
then in the search box typing

77
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,150
cmd and hitting Enter.

78
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,880
And again, I get a command
shell that pops up.

79
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,220
Switching back to
Windows 10, everything I

80
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,150
do here you can also do on
earlier versions of Windows,

81
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,780
such as Windows 7.

82
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,870
The command shell
is largely the same

83
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,520
in most versions of the
Windows operating system.

84
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,240
At least it's the same for
our purposes in the ways

85
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,050
that we will be using it.

86
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,620
So if you take a look at what's
been printed in the shell,

87
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,610
you'll see it says C: backslash
Users backslash shannon.

88
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,550
This is simply a folder in
the file system for my Windows

89
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:25,390
machine, and I can find
that folder if I look

90
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,800
in C:, Users, shannon.

91
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,390
So C:, Users, shannon
is exactly this folder.

92
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,670
C:, Users, shannon.

93
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,970
Now if I want to
run the mongo shell

94
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,290
on many versions of Windows, I
need to do one additional step,

95
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,800
and that is I need
to set up my path.

96
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,300
If you've never
done this before,

97
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,480
don't be worried about it.

98
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,480
It's a pretty
straightforward process.

99
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,500
But it is down in the
weeds a little bit.

100
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,020
So we'll take it
one step at a time.

101
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:05,790
So to do this, I can
type system environment,

102
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,070
and just to be
complete, variables.

103
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,410
And long before
that, Windows will

104
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,840
have suggested this operation,
Edit the system environment

105
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
variables.

106
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,900
If I click on
that, what I'll see

107
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,600
is a window that pops up
for System Properties,

108
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,660
and the Advanced tab
is already selected.

109
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,450
If I click
Environment Variables,

110
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,240
then you'll see that I
have user environment

111
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,080
variables for shannon, and
system environment variables.

112
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,510
The one we're interested
in is this one, Path.

113
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,890
And if we select
Path and click Edit,

114
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,130
we'll see a list of folders.

115
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,750
These folders contain
executable files or programs

116
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,380
that can be run on
this Windows machine.

117
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,340
Now on Windows 10, it's
probably not strictly necessary

118
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,410
that we update the
environment variables.

119
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,140
But on many versions of
Windows, it is necessary.

120
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,720
So I'm going to show
you how to do it here.

121
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,575
Now as we said previously,
MongoDB is installed in C:,

122
00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:10,459
Program Files, MongoDB, Server,
3.4, and all of the executables

123
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:11,500
are in the bin directory.

124
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:18,030
So again, that's C:, Program
Files, MongoDB, Server, 3.4,

125
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:18,780
bin.

126
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,640
The way that that
folder structure

127
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,950
is represented in our path is
by separating each component

128
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,460
of the path with a backslash.

129
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,960
So for our path,
that looks like this.

130
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,290
C: backslash Program Files
backslash MongoDB backslash

131
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:43,150
Server backslash
3.4 backslash bin.

132
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,760
Finally, what I'd like to
do before we finish editing

133
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,260
this environment variable
is move this to the top.

134
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,670
In order to understand
why I wanted to do that,

135
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,900
let's talk a little bit
about how the path is used.

136
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,380
When I'm in the shell and I type
a command, like mongo-- again,

137
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,640
remember, mongo is the name of
the mongo shell executable--

138
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,430
Windows will look for
programs with that name

139
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,490
in each one of the
folders listed here.

140
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,010
And it does so in order.

141
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,610
So it will first check this
path to see if there are

142
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,680
any executables located there.

143
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,250
In this case, it will find one
called mongo and execute it.

144
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,910
The reason why I wanted to
place the MongoDB installation

145
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,520
directory first is
just in case you

146
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,700
have an older version
of MongoDB installed

147
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,160
because if you have an older
version of MongoDB installed,

148
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,490
chances are it's in your path
and you might accidentally

149
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,420
end up running that version
of the mongo shell instead.

150
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,310
Again, earlier versions
of the mongo shell

151
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,300
did not include support for
SSL, and we need that here.

152
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,050
So we really need to
be running the latest

153
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,420
version of the mongo shell,
which you can download

154
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,600
from the MongoDB Download
Center as part of the MongoDB

155
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,220
Enterprise Package.

156
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,780
So we can click OK here.

157
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,110
And now you'll note
that our path has

158
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:04,080
been updated to include
that individual path

159
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,480
that we just added, and
it's added at the front.

160
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,220
And note that it's separated
from the next item in the path

161
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,800
by a semicolon here.

162
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,610
This is one of those difference
points from Windows 7.

163
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,800
And by that I mean in
editing a path in Windows 10

164
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,310
you have this nice list
of items in your path.

165
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,820
In Windows 7, it's a
little bit more arcane,

166
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,159
for lack of a better
word, because in order

167
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,380
to change the
environment variable,

168
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,950
we actually need to
edit a string that

169
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,490
includes all of the components
of a path in one line.

170
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,220
So here I can do exactly
the same thing, system,

171
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,400
environment, and before
I'm even finished

172
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,520
typing Windows is suggesting
the right thing to me.

173
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,149
I click on it.

174
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:53,940
Again, it's System
Properties, Advanced tab

175
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,690
selected, I click on
Environment Variables.

176
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:03,410
And then if I scroll down here,
I can open my Path and Edit.

177
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,920
And see here, this
is what I mean.

178
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,750
We just have one line of text.

179
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,470
These are all of the same
elements of the path that we

180
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,940
saw in Windows 10.

181
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,670
But rather than being
on separate lines,

182
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,230
they're all in one line.

183
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,295
In order to update a
path using this older UI,

184
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:26,910
I can copy in my C: Program
Files MongoDB Server 3.4 bin

185
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,850
path, and then
type a semicolon so

186
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:35,250
that it is separated from
the next item in my path.

187
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,390
With that, I can
click OK, OK, OK.

188
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:43,740
And then I've updated
my path on Windows 7.

189
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,180
Returning to Windows 10, I
want to do the same thing.

190
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,620
Click OK.

191
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,190
And then what I want to
do is restart the Command

192
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,520
prompt because on many
versions of Windows,

193
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,040
it's only after I restart
the Command prompt

194
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,340
that those changes I made to
the path environment variable

195
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,010
will be reflected.

196
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,450
So I'm going to close that.

197
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,950
And I'll just start it the same
way, typing command and then

198
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,060
hitting Enter.

199
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,820
And now I'll be able to
execute the mongo shell.

200
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,130
So to verify that we've
installed it correctly

201
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,290
and that we've set up our path
correctly, what I'm going to do

202
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:22,650
is type mongo dash dash no db.

203
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:26,160
Now dash dash no db simply means
that we're just starting up

204
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,800
the mongo shell without
attempting to connect

205
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,860
to any MongoDB database.

206
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,360
We're doing this
simply as a means

207
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,610
of verifying that we've
installed the mongo

208
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:40,230
shell correctly and that we've
setup our path correctly.

209
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,560
And if you see a
message, such as this,

210
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,480
MongoDB shell version 3.4.6--

211
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,750
or later, depending on
when you're actually doing

212
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,830
this install.

213
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,650
As we roll out the
next version of MongoDB

214
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,140
your version number may change.

215
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,970
But you should see a message
very similar to this.

216
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,060
You have successfully
installed the mongo shell

217
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,280
and launched it correctly.

218
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,470
To quit the mongo shell
you can simply type, quit.

219
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,540
You can run the function Quit.

220
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,020
And that's it for
installing the mongo shell

221
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,040
and getting setup to do a number
of different CRUD operations

222
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,144
in the mongo shell.

223
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:16,560
For the sake of
completeness, I'll

224
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,520
do the same thing in Windows 7.

225
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,130
So I close the Command
prompt, launch it again,

226
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,569
and run mongo dash dash no db.

227
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:28,110
And here we can see that we have
a slightly different startup

228
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:28,980
message.

229
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,290
This is pointing
you to documentation

230
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,700
and to Google Groups where
you can ask questions.

231
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,740
For this class,
please make sure you

232
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,070
direct your questions to the
MongoDB discussion forum.

233
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,950
If you post in Google Groups,
we will just direct you

234
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,110
to the discussion forum anyway.

235
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,110
Before we close out, I
want to say one last thing.

236
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:54,970
If for any reason you have
trouble installing MongoDB,

237
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,210
please visit the
MongoDB documentation

238
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,020
for installing MongoDB
Enterprise on Windows.

239
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,800
This is a simple
Google query away,

240
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,180
and there is extensive
documentation for how

241
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,900
to install MongoDB on Windows.

242
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,281
You can, of course, also ask for
help in the discussion forum.

243
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:16,780
But before posting,
please make sure

244
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,315
you do a search in
the forum to see

245
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:19,690
whether your
question has already

246
00:12:19,690 --> 00:00:00,000
been asked and answered.
