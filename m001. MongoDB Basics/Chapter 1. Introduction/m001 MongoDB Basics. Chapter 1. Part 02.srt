1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,910
In this lesson, we'll begin
our exploration of MongoDB.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,950
To do this we'll
use Compass, which

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,650
is the MongoDB GUI client.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,780
If you've not already done
so, please open Compass

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,110
and follow along as we
move through this lesson.

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,620
I've included instructions for
download and launch of Compass

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,020
in the lecture notes
for this lesson.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,620
Compass provides a UI for
viewing MongoDB databases

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,420
and the documents they contain.

10
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,750
It also supports the
MongoDB query language,

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,400
and enables us to
read and write data

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,730
using a number of conveniences
for building queries.

13
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,160
Here we're looking at
Compass's connection screen.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,770
On the left side, you
should see a navigation bar,

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,590
with sections for Favorites
and Recent Connections.

16
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,150
In the center view
here, you should

17
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,250
see a form we can use to
establish a connection

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,810
to a MongoDB cluster.

19
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,270
Please note that Compass
is actively developed.

20
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,210
There might be differences
between the UI I show here

21
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,800
and what you are seeing now.

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,810
In a moment, we'll connect
to a MongoDB cluster

23
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,790
we have set up for this class.

24
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,770
This cluster is
running in Atlas,

25
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,129
which is MongoDB's hosted
MongoDB as a service platform.

26
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,020
See the lecture notes for more
information on MongoDB Atlas.

27
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,960
Also don't worry about my
use of the term cluster.

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,390
If it is unfamiliar to you.

29
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,070
For now, it's not important.

30
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,030
In a later lesson, we'll dive
into what a MongoDB cluster is.

31
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,460
OK, so now we're
ready to connect.

32
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,610
You can see the hostname
for our cluster here.

33
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,310
I've also included it in
the lecture notes below.

34
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,111
We will connect on the
default port of 27017.

35
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:36,860
As the authentication method,
we'll use username password.

36
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,895
Please use the
username m001-student.

37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:50,950
And the password
m001-mongodb-basics

38
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,420
We'll use admin as the
authentication database,

39
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,830
and specify Use System CA slash
Atlas Deployment for the SSL

40
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,360
field.

41
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,450
This simply means that we will
encrypt traffic between Compass

42
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,550
and our Atlas cluster.

43
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,590
Finally, before we press
the connect button,

44
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,729
please create a favorite
for this connection

45
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,880
that you can easily get back to.

46
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,300
Now click Connect, and load
the databases in the M001 class

47
00:02:17,300 --> 00:00:00,000
MongoDB deployment.
