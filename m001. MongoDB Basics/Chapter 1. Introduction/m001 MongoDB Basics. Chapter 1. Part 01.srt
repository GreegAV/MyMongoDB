1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,499


2
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:01,960
As we get started
with this course,

3
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,650
I'd like to talk about grading
and a few other logistics

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,710
just to make sure you know
how this course works.

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,920
You'll see three different types
of exercises in this course--

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,680
quizzes, labs--
which we also call

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,470
homework-- and a final exam.

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,550
You'll see quizzes after most
lesson videos in this course.

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,140
All quizzes are ungraded.

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,960
They're there to allow you
to test your understanding

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,880
of the lesson material.

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,630
You'll see labs-- or homework,
as we sometimes call them--

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,580
throughout each chapter.

14
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,770
The scores you get
on your labs make up

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,170
50% of your final grade.

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,080
Then at the very end of
the course is a final exam.

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,570
This makes up the other
50% of your grade.

18
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,880
In terms of a course
schedule, in the first week

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,220
of this course, we
release chapter one.

20
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,650
We release chapter two
in the second week,

21
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,730
and then in the third
week of the course,

22
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,380
we release both chapter
three and the final exam.

23
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,995
And don't worry--
these two together

24
00:00:56,995 --> 00:00:59,370
are short enough that you
should be able to complete them

25
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,260
all in week three.

26
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,930
Please make sure you
check the course syllabus

27
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,920
for the exact release dates
for weeks one, two, and three.

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,100
In the syllabus, you'll
also find due dates

29
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,210
for when the labs or homework
are due for each week.

30
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,070
Once we've passed the due
date for the final exam,

31
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,050
if you've achieved a
grade of 65% or better,

32
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,110
you'll receive a statement of
completion for this course.

33
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,860
And again, we generate the
statements of completion

34
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,800
after the due date
for the final exam.

35
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,090
That's it for the
essential course logistics.

36
00:01:34,090 --> 00:00:00,000
We're glad you're learning
with us, and good luck.
