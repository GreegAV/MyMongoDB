00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,560
Hi, I'm Shannon.

3
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,930
And I'll be guiding you
through the basics of MongoDB

4
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,080
in this introductory course.

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,490
MongoDB eliminates a number
of technical challenges

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,660
that slow the pace of
application development.

7
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,220
In this course, we'll go
through the fundamentals

8
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,730
so that you can get up
and running with MongoDB.

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,670
First, we'll introduce
you to MongoDB Compass.

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,220
Compass is a visual
interface to MongoDB

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,800
that we'll use for many
lessons in this course.

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,570
It allows us to
configure a database

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,310
and explore the
data it contains.

14
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,740
We'll use Compass to
explore a few data-sets

15
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,430
and talk about the important
design features such as support

16
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,400
for flexible schemas and
the range of benefits

17
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,370
that it provides to
application developers.

18
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,130
Then we'll dive into the
MongoDB query language

19
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,960
to give you plenty
of preparation

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,080
as you begin to think about
building your own MongoDB

21
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,556
application.

22
00:00:51,556 --> 00:00:52,930
Throughout the
course, we'll make

23
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,220
use of Atlas, which is MongoDB's
database as a service offering.

24
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,350
We've created a database
cluster in Atlas

25
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,080
specifically for
use in this course.

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,239
You'll be connecting
to and using it

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,310
for many lessons and labs.

28
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,230
As you begin moving
through this course,

29
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,630
please take advantage
of the discussion forum.

30
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,460
Feel free to ask any
questions you have

31
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,040
about lessons or assignments.

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,340
Many students also ask questions
about more general MongoDB

33
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,510
questions, and that's OK too.

34
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,360
We have teaching assistants
monitoring the discussion forum

35
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,230
to help you.

36
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,570
In addition, other
students frequently

37
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,300
jump in with great
advice and answers

38
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,980
if you get stuck on a lab.

39
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,240
We're almost ready to begin.

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,700
But before we do, I wanted to
make you aware of the MongoDB

41
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,530
University app.

42
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,960
Many learners like to
download lesson videos

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,050
to watch on their commute
or in other situations

44
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,870
where internet
bandwidth is unreliable.

45
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,590
The MongoDB University
app available on both iOS

46
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,320
and Android makes this easy.

47
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,340
Search the App Store or Google
Play for MongoDB University

48
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,930
and give the app a try.

49
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,780
Most of our learners use it
for at least some portion

50
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,340
of every course.

51
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,718
OK, that's all the information
you need to get started.

52
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,008
If you have any questions or
comments about the course,

53
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:11,320
again, please feel
free to post something

54
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,880
in the discussion forum.

55
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,770
We're happy to
have you on board.

56
00:02:14,770 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks for learning
with us, and good luck.
