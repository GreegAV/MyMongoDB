1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,500
OK, now let's browse some of
the collections in this cluster.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,780
If you look to the left
in the Compass interface,

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,620
you'll see a navigation
panel containing

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,300
a list of all databases in the
cluster we are connected to,

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,000
with the collections
those databases contain

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,720
nested below them.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,120
Note that you can return
to this view at any point

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,460
by clicking the Home icon.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,780
Right now however, we want to
dive into the collections here.

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,260
We have quite a
few databases here.

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,780
These are the collections we'll
use throughout the course.

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,840
They contain a variety
of types of data,

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,299
and a range of data models,
so that we can illustrate

14
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,060
different features of MongoDB.

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,580
To access documents
within any collection,

16
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,520
simply locate the collection
in this navigation panel

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,720
and click.

18
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,700
As an example, let's take a
look at the movies collection

19
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,660
of the videos database.

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,060
As you click on
this collection, you

21
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,820
should see a schema
view for the collection

22
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,840
appear in the main panel.

23
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,500
The schema view provides
a list of the fields

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,040
found in documents
within this collection.

25
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,060
As you might expect
for movies, we

26
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,800
have fields for
director, genre, plot,

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,160
and a number of other
features relevant to movies.

28
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,640
As we scroll through, we can see
all fields found in documents

29
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,000
in this collection.

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,780
Again, this view
provides a summary

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,480
of the schema, or data
model, for documents

32
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,980
in this collection.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,600
We have the list of
fields, their data types,

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and a summary of the range
of values for each field

35
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,220
found throughout the
documents in the collection.

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,220
We'll return to a more detailed
walkthrough of this information

37
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,540
in a later lesson.

38
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,520
For now, let's dig into
this collection a bit,

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,480
and look at a few
specific documents.

40
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,160
If we click the
Documents tab, you

41
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,500
should see a list of documents
within this collection.

42
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,360
This view gives us the ability
to browse the actual data found

43
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,680
in this collection.

44
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,880
Here we can see a document
recording the details

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,520
for a one minute long
film called Carmencita

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,720
that was produced in 1894.

47
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,080
As we scroll through this view,
we can see other documents

48
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,540
in this collection.

49
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,420
In later lessons,
we'll look at how

50
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,140
to query this data
to find documents

51
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,979
matching a specific
set of filter criteria.

52
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,400
We'll also learn how to
insert new documents,

53
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,480
and update existing
ones, with new data.

54
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,420
Go ahead and explore
this data a bit,

55
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,620
and peek in on the other
collections in this Atlas cluster. And then, move on
to the next lesson.

56
00:02:23,400 --> 00:00:00,000
And then, move on
to the next lesson.
