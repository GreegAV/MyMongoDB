In addition to nested documents, MongoDB also supports array values for fields.

In this data set, we can see an example of array in the section's field.

For this example, it's going to be best if we look at the Documents tab, in Compass.

In this tab, we see not just a summary view of the schema for documents in a collection, but we can look at the actual documents our 100 Year Weather collection contains.

Documents in this data set contain measurements for a consistent set of meteorological readings.

These include air temperature, pressure, wind, etc.

But there are more than 100 other readings that might be available as well, depending on the weather station.

Supplementary values, such as these, are labeled using a three to four character code following a standard established for meteorological data.

Because MongoDB has a flexible data model, all documents don't have to contain exactly the same fields.

So in this data set, the supplementary readings available in a specific document are stored in the section's field in this data set.

Since the available readings will vary from one document to the next, it makes sense to provide a summary list of what supplemental readings are available in a given document.

An array is a good choice for this in MongoDB.

The MongoDB query language supports queries on array fields that make it easy for us to filter documents containing a particular set of supplementary fields.

And the advantage of noting the supplementary data this way is that we simply need to build an index on sections, and can then very quickly look up documents containing a specific set of supplementary data.
