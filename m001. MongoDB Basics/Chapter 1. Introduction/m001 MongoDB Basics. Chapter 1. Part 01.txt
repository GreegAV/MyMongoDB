As we get started with this course, I'd like to talk about grading and a few other logistics just to make sure you know how this course works.

You'll see three different types of exercises in this course-- quizzes, labs-- which we also call homework-- and a final exam.

You'll see quizzes after most lesson videos in this course.

All quizzes are ungraded.

They're there to allow you to test your understanding of the lesson material.

You'll see labs-- or homework, as we sometimes call them-- throughout each chapter.

The scores you get on your labs make up 50% of your final grade.

Then at the very end of the course is a final exam.

This makes up the other 50% of your grade.

In terms of a course schedule, in the first week of this course, we release chapter one.

We release chapter two in the second week, and then in the third week of the course, we release both chapter three and the final exam.

And don't worry-- these two together are short enough that you should be able to complete them all in week three.

Please make sure you check the course syllabus for the exact release dates for weeks one, two, and three.

In the syllabus, you'll also find due dates for when the labs or homework are due for each week.

Once we've passed the due date for the final exam, if you've achieved a grade of 65% or better, you'll receive a statement of completion for this course.

And again, we generate the statements of completion after the due date for the final exam.

That's it for the essential course logistics.

We're glad you're learning with us, and good luck.
