1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,230
Once connected, you should see
a screen that looks like this.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,840
Here in the main
panel, we can see

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,750
a list of the databases
contained in this cluster.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:15,290
In MongoDB, a database serves
as a namespace for collections.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,940
Collections store individual
records called documents.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,210
This graphic illustrates the
relationship between databases,

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,820
collections, and documents.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,810
This hierarchy allows us
to group together records

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,900
of similar items
within collections,

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,350
and group collections required
for the same application

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,810
within the same database.

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,900
We can also establish security
policies that authorize users

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,940
with different roles
and different levels

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,120
of access at the database,
or collection, level.

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,010
MongoDB does not currently
support authorization settings

16
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,860
specific to
individual documents.

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,000
Each database and collection
combination define a namespace.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,750
We typically reference
a specific collection

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,740
by expressing the name of the
database, followed by a dot,

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,740
followed by the name
of the collection.

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,690
Returning to
Compass, here we have

22
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,410
a listing of all the
databases in this cluster.

23
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,440
With a little bit of information
about the size of the database,

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,900
the number of
collections it contains,

25
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,480
and the number of indexes
on these collections.

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,130
We won't say too much about
indexes in this course.

27
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,570
You'll want to take the MongoDB
performance course for that.

28
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,590
Just look for M201 on the
MongoDB university website.

29
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,360
By the way, if the list
of databases you're seeing

30
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,360
differs a little bit from
what I'm showing here,

31
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:39,860
don't worry about that.

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:00:00,000
We update this cluster from time to time with new datasets.
